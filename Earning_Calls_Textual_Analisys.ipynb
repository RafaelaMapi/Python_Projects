And of course, I very much echo the sentiment. Now let's turn to our third quarter earnings results. The presentation is available on our website, and please refer to the disclaimer in the back.</p> <p>Starting on Page 1. The firm reported net income of $13.2 billion, EPS of $4.33 on revenue of $40.7 billion, and delivered an ROTCE of 22%. These results included $669 million of net investment securities losses in Corporate and $665 million of firmwide legal expense. On Page 2, we have some more detail.</p><div class=\"interad\"></div> <p>Similar to last quarter, we have called out the impact of First Republic where relevant. For this quarter, First Republic contributed $2.2 billion of revenue, $858 million of expense, and $1.1 billion of net income. Now focusing on the firmwide results, excluding First Republic, revenue of $38.5 billion was up $5 billion or 15% year on year. NII ex markets was up $4.8 billion or 28% driven by higher rates and higher revolving balance card, partially offset by lower deposit balances.</p> <p>NIR ex-markets was up $374 million or 4%, which included lower net investment securities losses than the prior year. End market revenue was down $190 million or 3% year on year. Expenses of $20.9 billion were up $1.7 billion or 9% year on year primarily driven by ongoing growth in front office and technology staffing as well as wage inflation and higher legal expense. And credit costs were $1.4 billion predominantly driven by net charge-offs in card and included a $102 million net reserve release driven by changes in the central scenario, primarily offset by card loan growth.</p> <p>On to balance sheet and capital on Page 3. We ended the quarter with a CET1 ratio of 14.3%, up about 50 basis points versus the prior quarter as the benefit of net income less capital distributions was partially offset by AOCI. We had $2 billion of net share repurchases this quarter, and the pace of buybacks will likely remain modest in light of the Basel III Endgame proposal. In line with our capital hierarchy, we'll continue to reassess the buyback trajectory as circumstances evolve or opportunities emerge.</p> <p>And on the topic of the Basel III Endgame, you'll see that we added a couple of pages on it. So let's cover that now, starting on Page 4. Given the significance of this proposal for us, the broader industry as well as households and businesses as end users, we thought it was important to spend time discussing it. And while we know the interest in having us quantify the expected impact of this proposal in a lot of granular detail, it's important to start by asking why the proposed increase is so large, given the repeated statement over time by policymakers that banks are well capitalized and well-positioned to deal with stress.</p><div class=\"interad\"></div> <p>Given that context, the absence of detailed analysis supporting a capital increase of this magnitude is disconcerting, and there's a lot that does not make sense to us. Starting with RWA. We've already said we expect the firm's RWA to increase by around 30% or $500 billion, which results in capital requirements increasing by about 25% or $50 billion. One immediate thing to point out is that at 4.5% GSIB, a $500 billion increase in RWA requires $22.5 billion of additional capital with no change in our systemic risk footprint.</p> <p>We've been on the record for a long time that GSIB was conceptually flawed and miscalibrated originally. Since implementation, the failure to address economic growth despite the Fed themselves acknowledging this problem at the outset has made matters worse. And now all of those problems are being applied to an additional $500 billion of RWA. Our view is that the combined proposals could have adjusted the surcharge levels to keep dollars of capital associated with the GSIB buffer constant rather than simply multiplying the RWA increase by the existing surcharges.</p> <p>Another lens on the proposed increases is the introduction of RWA for operational risk and its clear overlap with op risk losses already capitalized through the stress capital buffer. Although there is limited disclosure from the Fed on this point, we have estimated that we have about $15 billion of operational risk capital embedded in the SCB based on the information the Fed does disclose. Once we capitalize for this new op risk RWA, our required capital will go up by around $30 billion without any change to our portfolio. Now let's turn to Page 5, which shows the impact of the actual and proposed capital rules over the last few years.</p> <p>Zooming out from the details of this most recent proposal, this page reminds us of what's happened since 2017. Since then, SACR and the stress capital buffer have been adopted and our GSIB surcharge will increase to 4.5%. So assuming the Basel III Endgame and GSIB proposals are finalized in their current form, we would see a 45% increase in our capital requirements relative to that 2017 starting point. This illustrates again how overcalibrated these proposals are, and it's not done yet.</p> <p>We still expect the Fed to incorporate CECL into CCAR, which will likely increase the SCB. And of course, given the absence of effect to the GSIB flaws, it continues to present a headwind into the indefinite future. And aside from those dynamics, there remains the long-standing issue of procyclicality in the overall capital reform. We think it's also important to point out that the agencies did actually have a choice here.</p> <p>While it may technically be true that the proposal is Basel-compliant, Basel compliance does not mandate a 25% increase in capital requirements. Implementing the Basel III end game consistently with how the Europeans have by retaining credit risk modeling and also addressing the compounding effects of GSIB and SCB would have achieved Basel compliance without creating this unnecessary increase in capital requirements. As you would expect, we will continue to engage and forcefully advocate during the comment period and beyond in a great deal of technical detail. For the purposes of this call, we wanted to make the equally important broader plans about both the level of capital increase and the flaws in the construct of the framework itself since coherent design is critical to the framework's durability over time.</p> <p>The current proposal exacerbates existing features to discourage beneficial scale and diversification. If it goes through as written, there will likely be significant impacts on pricing and availability of credit for businesses and consumers. In addition, the ongoing and persistent increase in the regulatory cost of market-making for banks suggest that the regulators want dramatic changes to the current operation of the U.S. capital markets.</p> <p>We believe that well-regulated market makers that are committed to deploying capital to clients on a principal basis are a critical building block supporting the breadth, depth, and resilience of the American capital markets, which is vital to the U.S. economy. So caution is warranted when proposing changes of this magnitude. With that, we go to our businesses, starting with CCB on Page 6.</p> <p>Consumer spend growth has now reverted to pre-pandemic trends with nominal spend for customer stable and relatively flat year on year. Cash buffers continue to normalize to pre-pandemic levels with lower income groups normalizing faster. Turning now to the financial results, excluding First Republic. CCB reported net income of $5.3 billion on revenue of $17 billion, which was up 19% year on year.</p> <p>In Banking and Wealth Management, revenue was up 30% year on year driven by higher NII on higher rates. End-of-period deposits were down 3% quarter on quarter. We ranked No. 1 in retail deposit share based on FDIC data and continue to solidify our leadership position in key markets.</p> <p>Client investment assets were up 21% year on year driven by market performance and strong net inflows as we continue to capture yield-seeking flows from our Consumer Banking customers. In Home Lending, revenue was down 2% year on year, given a smaller market. Originations of $10.3 billion were up slightly quarter on quarter, but they remained down 15% year on year. Moving to Card Services &amp; Auto.</p> <p>Revenue was up 7% year on year driven by higher Card Services NII on higher revolving balances, partially offset by lower auto lease income. Card outstandings were up 16% year on year due to strong account acquisition and continued normalization of revolve. And then auto originations were $10.2 billion, up 36% year on year as we saw competitors pull back and we gained market share. Expenses of $8.5 billion were up 7% year on year largely driven by continued investments in staffing, primarily in front office and technology.</p> <p>In terms of credit performance this quarter, credit costs were $1.4 billion driven by net charge-offs, which were up $720 million year on year predominantly due to continued normalization of card. The net reserve build of $49 million reflected a $301 million build in Card Services, primarily offset by a $250 million release in Home Lending. Next, the CIB on Page 7. CIB reported net income of $3.1 billion on revenue of $11.7 billion.</p> <p>Investment Banking revenue of $1.6 billion was down 6% year on year. IB fees were down 3% year on year, and we ranked No. 1 with a year-to-date wallet share of 8.6%. In advisory, fees were down 10%.</p> <p>Underwriting fees were up 8% for debt and down 6% for equity. In terms of the outlook, we're encouraged by the level of capital markets activity in September, and we have a healthy pipeline going into the fourth quarter. Advisory has also picked up compared to the first half, but year-to-date announced M&amp;A remains down significantly, which will continue to be a headwind. Payments revenue was $2.1 billion, up 3% year on year.</p> <p>Excluding equity investments, it was up 12% driven by higher rates, partially offset by lower deposit balances. Moving to Markets. Total revenue was $6.6 billion, down 3% year on year against a very strong third quarter last year. Fixed income was up 1% driven by an increase in financing and trade activity and securitized products as well as improved performance in credit.</p> <p>This was predominantly offset by Currencies and emerging Markets coming off a very strong quarter last year. Equity Markets was down 10%, reflecting lower revenues across products compared to a strong prior-year quarter as activity was challenged by lower volatility. Securities Services revenue of $1.2 billion was up 9% year on year driven by higher rates, partially offset by lower deposit balances. Expenses of $7.4 billion were up 11% year on year predominantly driven by higher legal expense and wage inflation.</p> <p>Credit costs were a net benefit of $185 million driven by a net reserve release of $230 million, reflecting the impact of net lending activity and net charge-offs of $45 million. Moving to the Commercial Bank on Page 8. Commercial Banking reported net income of $1.7 billion. Revenue of $3.7 billion was up 20% year on year with payments revenue of $2 billion, up 30% year on year driven by higher rates and gross Investment Banking and Markets revenue of $821 million was up 8% year on year, reflecting increased M&amp;A volume.</p> <p>Expenses of $1.4 billion were up 15% year on year largely driven by an increase in headcount, including front office and technology investments as well as higher volume-related expense, including the impact of new client acquisition. Average deposits were down 7% year on year and 5% quarter on quarter primarily driven by lower nonoperating deposits as clients opt for higher-yielding alternatives. Loans were up 1% quarter on quarter. C&amp;I loans were flat, reflecting continued stabilization in new loan demand and revolver utilization.</p> <p>And CRE loans were up 1%, reflecting funding of prior year originations in real estate banking as well as lower payoff activity. Finally, credit costs were $64 million, including net charge-offs of $50 million and a net reserve build of $14 million. Then to complete our lines of business, AWM on Page 9. Asset and Wealth Management reported net income of $1.1 billion with a pre-tax margin of 31%.</p> <p>Revenue of $4.6 billion was relatively flat year on year as higher management fees on strong net inflows and higher average market levels were offset by lower performance fees and lower NII from deposits. Expenses of $3.1 billion were up 3% year on year driven by continued growth in our private banking advisory teams and the impact of closing the JPMorgan Asset Management China and global shares acquisitions. For the quarter, net long-term inflows were $20 billion, positive across all asset classes led by equities. And in liquidity, we saw net inflows of $40 billion.</p> <p>AUM of $3.2 trillion was up 22% year on year, and client assets of $4.6 trillion were up 21% year on year driven by continued net inflows of higher-margin levels. Finally, loans were flat quarter on quarter, while deposits were down 5% driven by migration to investments, partially offset by client inflows. Turning to Corporate on Page 10. Corporate reported net income of $911 million.</p> <p>Revenue was $1.5 billion, up $1.8 billion compared to last year. NII was $2 billion, up $1.2 billion year on year due to the impact of higher rates. And NIR was a net loss of $506 million and included the net investment securities losses I mentioned upfront. Expenses of $456 million were up $151 million year on year.</p> <p>To finish, we have the outlook on Page 11. We now expect 2023 NII and NII ex markets to be approximately $88.5 billion and $89 billion, respectively, with the increase driven by slower reprice than previously assumed. Consistent with what we've been saying throughout the year, while we don't know when it will normalize, we do not consider this level of NII to be sustainable. Our outlook for 2023 adjusted expense is now approximately $84 billion.</p> <p>And as a reminder, this is on an adjusted basis, which excludes legal expense. Also, remember this outlook excludes the pending FDIC special assessment. On credit, we now expect the 2023 card net charge-off rate to be approximately 2.5% mostly driven by denominator effects due to recent balance growth. So to wrap up, we're pleased with another quarter of strong operating results.</p> <p>Throughout the year, we've been pointing out the various sources of significant uncertainty. And all of those, including the geopolitical situation, economic outlook, rate environment, deposit reprice and the impact of the Basel III Endgame proposal are as prominent now as they have been in the recent past. But as always, we continue to prepare for a range of scenarios and are focused on being there for our clients and customers when they need us most. And with that, let's open the line for Q&amp;A.</p> <h2>Questions &amp; Answers:</h2><br/> <p><strong>Operator</strong></p><p>Thank you. Please stand by. Our first question comes from John McDonald with Autonomous Research. You may proceed.</p><p><strong>John McDonald</strong> -- <em>Autonomous Research -- Analyst</em></p> <p>Hi. Good morning. Jeremy, I was wondering if you could give us a little more color on what you're seeing so far on deposit reprice and migration, what's been better than expected so far on that front? And how do you see higher for longer rates potentially impacting deposit reprice pressure?</p><p><strong>Jeremy Barnum</strong> -- <em>Chief Financial Officer</em></p> <p>Sure. Thanks, John. I think the themes are pretty much the same as we've seen in prior quarters. So as we talked a little bit about on the press call, we've been trying to be a little bit cautious about recognizing that we don't think the current levels are sustainable.</p> <p>And we do think that we'll have to reprice in some pockets to some degree, maybe tiering or whatever at some point in the future. And of course, that hasn't happened yet this year. So that's one factor. In the meantime, the CD strategy is working well.</p> <p>We're going to continue to get very good feedback from the field, and we're capturing money in motion. And so we're seeing the sort of internal migration associated with slow increase in deposit rate paid as a result of CD migration, but that's sort of working as we would have hoped. And so everything is kind of playing out according to plan, I would say. In terms of higher for longer, I think it just means that there will continue to be upward pressure on deposit pricing, both from internal migration and possibly from other effects.</p> <p>And at the end, as we always say, we're going to price products as a function of the competitive market environment.</p><p><strong>John McDonald</strong> -- <em>Autonomous Research -- Analyst</em></p> <p>And just as a follow-up, it seems like you've done some securities repositioning in the last couple of quarters. How are you positioning the balance sheet in terms of cash in the securities portfolio, given your outlook for rates?</p><p><strong>Jeremy Barnum</strong> -- <em>Chief Financial Officer</em></p> <p>Yes. I think I would say that while we're not predicting higher rates, I'm sure Jamie will have something to say here, we believe in being prepared for it. And that's been our position for some time. And of course, that's produced good results, and we continue to try to position ourselves.</p> <p>So neither significantly higher rates nor significant lower rates present a particularly large challenge to the company. So probably at the margin, we're still a little bit biased for slightly higher rates. But do keep in mind that when modeling the duration of the balance sheet, higher rates do extend the duration or rather shorten the duration on the deposit side, so that can be a factor as well.</p><p><strong>John McDonald</strong> -- <em>Autonomous Research -- Analyst</em></p> <p>OK. Thanks.</p><p><strong>Operator</strong></p><p>Thank you. Our next question comes from Steven Chubak with Wolfe Research. You may proceed.</p><p><strong>Steven Chubak</strong> -- <em>Wolfe Research -- Analyst</em></p> <p>Hey. Good morning. Jeremy, I was hoping to just inquire about capital market outlook. You cited improved activity levels in September.</p> <p>But given persistently higher rates, geopolitical tensions and just poor performance of recent IPOs, how you're thinking about the outlook over the near to medium term? And how are you thinking about just the timing of an inflection in activity?</p><p><strong>Jeremy Barnum</strong> -- <em>Chief Financial Officer</em></p> <p>Yeah. Good question. I mean, as you know, obviously, the current levels in Investment Banking remain quite depressed, certainly relative to the very elevated levels that we saw during the pandemic but even relative to sort of 2019, which is what you might consider the last normal year. We do eventually think we'll recover to those levels and hopefully recover to above those levels, recognizing that by the time it happens, you will have had many years of economic growth in the meantime.</p> <p>And to be fair, while the current environment is a little bit complicated in mix and there are some headwinds, as you pointed out, things have improved a little bit. And I think I would say our banking team is a little bit more optimistic than they were last quarter. So it feels to me like a little bit of a slow grind with some positive momentum, but obviously, significant uncertainty in the outlook and some structural headwinds, given lower levels of announced M&amp;A and some regulatory headwinds on that side.</p><p><strong>Steven Chubak</strong> -- <em>Wolfe Research -- Analyst</em></p> <p>And just for my follow-up on some of the regulatory commentary you provided. Certainly, a lot of helpful color on the slide. So thank you for that. If the proposal were to go through as written, what proportion of the inflation do you believe can be mitigated over time? And I was also hoping you could provide some context as to the quantum of how you think CECL inclusion could potentially impact the SCB and CCAR.</p><p><strong>Jeremy Barnum</strong> -- <em>Chief Financial Officer</em></p> <p>Yeah. Those are all good questions, Steve. I think it's probably too early to try to provide that level of quantification on either front. If I start first with the Basel III end game proposal, from our perspective, we're currently focused on advocating as aggressively as possible for the necessary changes, some of which are what you might call philosophical in nature or some of the things I highlighted in my prepared remarks.</p> <p>But some of them are very technical in nature, including things that we think might actually be mistakes on the proposal. And so talking a lot about optimizing away stuff that might change just feels like a bit premature at this point. I would point out that given how significant operational risk RWA is as part of the proposal, that is -- you can think of that sort of as a generic tax across the entire spectrum. And it's therefore, in some sense, non-optimizable.</p> <p>So we feel that it's important to manage expectations about the level of optimization that's possible once the rule is finalized and hopefully some of the technical items are addressed. Also, it depends on your definition of optimization. There's what I -- sometimes I use the term costless optimization, where it's just technical fixes that don't affect revenue and don't require you to exit businesses. I think that type of optimization will be harder to find than it has been in the past.</p> <p>But as we pointed out, we may simply need to exit things. And that will be because it is better than the alternative, which would be to do activity that's shareholder value disruptive, but it won't be costless. A good example of that is the renewable energy tax credit investment business, which as a result of the quadrupling of the risk weight may no longer make sense. Now that's one that we hope will be changed but is tricky because those are very long-duration assets.</p> <p>So between now and the rule is finalized, it raises some questions whether we want to put that stuff on the balance sheet. So sorry, a bit of a long answer. But then, yes, on quantifying CECL and CCAR, I think we've got to wait for that one because given the relative lack of transparency that we have into the Fed's exact modeling in terms of which quarter is the peak and so on and so forth, it's a little bit hard to predict what the exact impact of putting CECL and CCAR is going to be. We just know probabilistically that it will, like everything else these days, tend to push capital higher.</p><p><strong>Steven Chubak</strong> -- <em>Wolfe Research -- Analyst</em></p> <p>Very helpful color, Jeremy. Thanks for taking my question.</p><p><strong>Operator</strong></p><p>Thank you. Our next question comes from Ebrahim Poonawala with Bank of America. You may proceed.</p><p><strong>Ebrahim Poonawala</strong> -- <em>Bank of America Merrill Lynch -- Analyst</em></p> <p>Hey. Good morning. Just first question, Jeremy, on credit. I think you mentioned some of the reserve release was tied to the change in the central scenario.</p> <p>Could you just talk to us, remind us what the central scenario is today, what changed? And then in terms of fundamentally on credit, like where are you seeing softness either on the consumer or the commercial side?</p><p><strong>Jeremy Barnum</strong> -- <em>Chief Financial Officer</em></p> <p>Yes. So on the central scenario, you should read the research that gets put out by our competitors and our excellent research team. No, but in all seriousness, I think our U.S. economists had their central case outlook to include a very mild recession with, I think, two quarters of negative 0.5% of GDP growth in the fourth quarter and first quarter of this year.</p> <p>And that then got revised out early this quarter to now have sort of modest growth, I think, around 1% for a few quarters into 2024. So just flowing that through our process while acknowledging that we're still skewed to the downside. We're still reserved to a significantly higher unemployment rate on a weighted average basis than is in the central case outlook. So that number would be sometimes giving you this 5.5% this quarter.</p> <p>So it's really not much more complicated than that. We're just kind of following the process. And I think your other question was where am I seeing softness in credit. And I think the answer to that is actually nowhere roughly or certainly nowhere that's not expected, meaning we continue to see the normalization story play out in consumer more or less exactly as expected.</p> <p>And then, of course, we are seeing a trickle of charge-offs coming through the office space. You see that in the charge-off number of the Commercial Bank. But the numbers are very small and more or less just the realization of the allowance that we've already built there.</p><p><strong>Ebrahim Poonawala</strong> -- <em>Bank of America Merrill Lynch -- Analyst</em></p> <p>That's helpful. And just going back to the details you laid out on Basel end game. Maybe on the philosophical side, I think Jamie was speaking last month said doesn't -- we don't expect any changes. But at the same time, you make everything that makes sense in terms of the pushback.</p> <p>Is it all falling on deaf ears from a shareholder perspective? Are we resigned to the fact that we are going to see more toward the worst case outcome play out? Or is there some level of sort of meeting in the middle of the road as this thing gets finalized?</p><p><strong>Jeremy Barnum</strong> -- <em>Chief Financial Officer</em></p> <p>Yeah. So I'll let Jamie speak for himself on that point, but our job is to advocate. We're not going to guess what the sentiment is in Washington. It's a 1,000-page rule proposal, as you know.</p> <p>We've got a big team of very smart people studying it very closely. Interestingly, we noted recently that in some of the analysis that they did about the impact on lending, they sort of forgot about like $1 billion of the Fed and their preamble, they forgot about $1 billion of operational risk RWA. So it just highlights that there is a possibility or seem to have forgotten. They simply omitted the impact of the operational risk RWA on fees.</p> <p>So anyway, the point is it's long, it's complicated, it's technical. We do think there are probably some technical mistakes and there -- cannot forcefully advocate on all of those. And while we disagree with a lot of this stuff, these are technical issues that should be, in some sense, resolved technically. And hopefully, they'll listen.</p><p><strong>Ebrahim Poonawala</strong> -- <em>Bank of America Merrill Lynch -- Analyst</em></p> <p>Got it.</p><p><strong>Jeremy Barnum</strong> -- <em>Chief Financial Officer</em></p> <p>Sorry, I'm just getting a correction in the room. I meant to say $1 trillion.</p><p><strong>Ebrahim Poonawala</strong> -- <em>Bank of America Merrill Lynch -- Analyst</em></p> <p>Yeah. No, I got that. I got the $1 trillion. Yep, thanks.</p><p><strong>Jeremy Barnum</strong> -- <em>Chief Financial Officer</em></p> <p>What you're talking about actually put something out on it</p><p><strong>Ebrahim Poonawala</strong> -- <em>Bank of America Merrill Lynch -- Analyst</em></p> <p>Yeah. Thank you.</p><p><strong>Operator</strong></p><p>Thank you. Our next question comes from Ryan Kenny with Morgan Stanley. You may proceed.</p><p><strong>Ryan Kenny</strong> -- <em>Morgan Stanley -- Analyst</em></p> <p>Hey. Good morning. I want to dig in on the NII side. So you raised the 2023 NII markets guidance by $2 billion for this year.</p> <p>So I know your comments in the press release suggests JPMorgan's overearning. So I just want to triangulate there. What does normalized NII look like? And do we get to normalize next year or earlier on?</p><p><strong>Jeremy Barnum</strong> -- <em>Chief Financial Officer</em></p> <p>Yeah. A couple of things. So let me do the timing question first. So we're being very clear that we are not predicting when it's going to be a function of the marketplace and the rate environment and competitive dynamics and so on and so forth.</p> <p>So we're just really just trying to remind everyone not bank on the current run rate, which we just don't fundamentally think are sustainable. You'll be aware that before Investor Day last -- earlier this year, we tried to quantify what we thought that kind of normalized range might look like, and we put a sort of mid-70s type number out there. And at Investor Day, we talked about how the acquisition of First Republic was going to push that number up a little bit, although there were some overlaps and so on and so forth. So anyway, with the benefit of time and having everything settled in a little bit, if you sort of push us for that kind of what does that number now look like, we think it's probably closer to about 80 with all the obvious caveats that this is a guess and we don't know when.</p> <p>But we're just trying to point out that it's a bit lower than the current run rate.</p><p><strong>Jamie Dimon</strong> -- <em>Chairman and Chief Executive Officer</em></p> <p>Inside the company, some people think it will happen sooner, i.e., me. Some people think it will happen later, i.e., Jen and Maryann, and Jeremy.</p><p><strong>Jeremy Barnum</strong> -- <em>Chief Financial Officer</em></p> <p>I wasn't aware I was in that count. I don't know. I don't know.</p><p><strong>Ryan Kenny</strong> -- <em>Morgan Stanley -- Analyst</em></p> <p>Thanks. And then on the loan growth side, industry loan growth has slowed significantly this year. What demand are you seeing for loan growth across the different categories? And I know it might be too early to talk about next year, but directionally, how should we think about loan growth, given where we are in the cycle and the higher capital requirements coming?</p><p><strong>Jeremy Barnum</strong> -- <em>Chief Financial Officer</em></p> <p>Yeah, sure. So on loan growth, the story is pretty consistent with what we've been saying all year. So we were seeing very robust loan growth in card, and that's coming from both spending growth and the normalization of revolving balances. As we look forward, we're still optimistic about that, but it will probably be a little bit more muted than it has been during this normalization period.</p> <p>In auto, we've also seen pretty robust loan growth recently, both as a function of slightly more competitive pricing on our side as the industry was a little bit slow to raise rates. And so we lost some share previously, and that's come back now. And generally, the supply chain situation is better. So that's been supported.</p> <p>As we look forward there, it should be a little bit more muted. And I think generally in wholesale, the loan growth story is going to be driven just by the economic environment. So depending on what you believe about soft landing, mild recession, no lending, we have slightly lower or slightly higher loan growth, but in any case, I would expect it to be relatively muted. And of course, lending remains fairly constrained both by rates and market conditions.</p> <p>But also, and I think this is true across the board, we will be managing things actively, as mentioned in light of Basel III, which may not change originations, but it will change what we retain.</p><p><strong>Ryan Kenny</strong> -- <em>Morgan Stanley -- Analyst</em></p> <p>Thank you.</p><p><strong>Operator</strong></p><p>Thank you. Our next question comes from Gerard Cassidy with RBC. You may proceed.</p><p><strong>Gerard Cassidy</strong> -- <em>RBC Capital Markets -- Analyst</em></p> <p>Good morning, Jeremy. How are you?</p><p><strong>Jeremy Barnum</strong> -- <em>Chief Financial Officer</em></p> <p>Hey, Gerard.</p><p><strong>Gerard Cassidy</strong> -- <em>RBC Capital Markets -- Analyst</em></p> <p>Jeremy, you guys have put up a really strong ROTC number of 22% for the quarter. When you dive into your different segments, what really jumps out at us is the 40% ex First Republic ROE in Consumer and Community Banking. I know you and Jamie have talked about your over-earning on credit, we get that. But in view of all of these fintechs and all these other nonbank competitors that were all supposed to pick away at everybody's market share, you guys have put up great numbers here.</p> <p>What's the drivers behind an ROE, even when you take that credit overearning out, what's driving this business profitability at such high levels?</p><p><strong>Jeremy Barnum</strong> -- <em>Chief Financial Officer</em></p> <p>Yes, Gerard, I'd say a couple of things there. So first, it's not just credit, it's also deposit margin, right? So when we talk about overearning on NII, a disproportionate amount of that is coming out of the consumer franchise for all the reasons that we've talked about. But I would also point out, sometimes we don't like the word overearning because right now, customers are happy, and they're doing CDs. And the broader answer to your question about why we're able to beat effectively really comes back to a decade, two-decade-long history of investing for the future and recognizing that there's a holistic value proposition here that includes branches and the app and all the online services and the entire suite of products and services that is around this enterprise, which drives engagement and customer loyalty.</p> <p>And we're seeing some of the benefits of that now, although we're not complacent. The competition is still there. The fintechs are still there, and we know we need to continue investing to preserve the value. And it's also true that the particular circumstances of the current rate and credit environment means that the earnings are a little bit above normal, but that core franchise is extremely robust.</p><p><strong>Gerard Cassidy</strong> -- <em>RBC Capital Markets -- Analyst</em></p> <p>Very good. And then as a follow-up, which ties into your answer on the deposit margin and consumer and your earlier comments, you and Jamie, about the internal debate inside JPMorgan about the migration of rates going higher on the funding side. Your noninterest-bearing deposits, I think, are around 28% of total deposits, which is slightly above the 26% you guys had back in 2018 or pre-pandemic. Is this expectation that you're going to see more of the noninterest-bearing deposits going to interest-bearing? Or is it just the repricing of interest-bearing deposits that have some of your folks inside JPMorgan a little more cautious on that net interest income number?</p><p><strong>Jeremy Barnum</strong> -- <em>Chief Financial Officer</em></p> <p>Yeah. It's a good question, Gerard. I think it's a little bit bigger picture than that. And I'm not sure.</p> <p>I get your question. It's a good question, but I'm not sure that the reported interest-bearing, noninterest-bearing split is the best one to look at this through for a couple of reasons. So first, like between wholesale and retail, we've got some amount of noninterest-bearing in wholesale. That's sort of the ECR product, and so you see some dynamics there that play out.</p> <p>And in consumer, in a world where savings is paying a relatively low rate paid across checking and savings, the migration dynamics are probably not that different right now. But then, of course, even within consumer across both consumers and small businesses, you've got slightly different dynamics in terms of how people manage their operating balances. So I would tend to zoom out a little bit and see this as a holistic answer that's driven by internal migration from checking to earnings to CDs, from ECR to interest-bearing and wholesale. And then our potential response to the rate environment, the competitive environment, the overall level of systemwide deposits in terms of product-level reprice that may or may not happen at the moment in the future.</p><p><strong>Gerard Cassidy</strong> -- <em>RBC Capital Markets -- Analyst</em></p> <p>Great. Thank you.</p><p><strong>Operator</strong></p><p>Thank you. Our next question comes from Erika Najarian with UBS. You may proceed.</p><p><strong>Erika Najarian</strong> -- <em>UBS -- Analyst</em></p> <p>Hi. Good morning, Jeremy. My first question is for you. Again, sort of maybe reasking the question a different way.</p> <p>Your new guide for net interest income for this year would imply an exit run rate of $22.9 billion in the fourth quarter. As we think about the dynamics and higher for longer, on one hand, your fixed-rate assets will continue to reprice. On the other, you've been asked a lot about the deposit dynamics that could continue to creep higher. How do you think about those puts and takes as we think about that relative to that exit rate of $22.9 billion in the fourth quarter?</p><p><strong>Jeremy Barnum</strong> -- <em>Chief Financial Officer</em></p> <p>Yes. So, Erika, I think the simple answer to your question is those -- I believe that fourth quarter exit number equates to a $90 billion run rate ex markets. And we're kind of saying that -- yes, it's not what I meant to say.</p><p><strong>Jamie Dimon</strong> -- <em>Chairman and Chief Executive Officer</em></p> <p>She said $22 billion.</p><p><strong>Jeremy Barnum</strong> -- <em>Chief Financial Officer</em></p> <p>Oh, I didn't hear that. OK. Anyway, model that way. Anyway, so call it $90 billion run rate on an exit rate basis, and we're saying that we think something a bit more normal is closer to $80 billion.</p> <p>So that's one building block. Underneath that, I think one thing that's interesting, actually, is that as the percentage of the deposits which our CDs increases, the sort of balance between internal migration and betas and rate and volume, it's a little bit less binary and a little bit smoother. So when we look at this type of stuff and we model migration balances, product-level reprice as you get out of that lower zero bound with 0% CD mix world, things get a little bit smoother, I would say, overall. So it will be interesting to watch that, but it's obviously one of the most important things for us as a company right now.</p> <p>And we think we can manage it, but it's also worth remembering that the big picture point is just the client franchise. And we've often said, we're very focused on primary bank relationships, and we didn't lose any of those in the last cycle. We're not planning to lose any in this cycle, and that's what sort of a long-term focus means for us.</p><p><strong>Jamie Dimon</strong> -- <em>Chairman and Chief Executive Officer</em></p> <p>And I would just say quantitative tightening there. That will be a large number, and we don't exactly know the effect where wholesale, consumer as -- remember also the Fed has the RRP program, which is also sucking money into the Fed directly reducing deposits. That's still $1 trillion, too.</p><p><strong>Erika Najarian</strong> -- <em>UBS -- Analyst</em></p> <p>And my second question is on maybe zooming out on the Basel III Endgame impacts. It's clearly complex, overly complex. And I completely agree with you that it is unnecessary at this point and very backward-looking. I guess what is not complex is the fact that you generated 75 basis points of CET1 this quarter while your RWAs are down.</p> <p>And I guess my question here is, is that I understand that we're in the public advocacy process. I hear you loud and clear in terms of how this could have harm in terms of pricing for Main Street and dislocating the pipes in American capital markets. But for JPMorgan, this change your natural return profile of 17%. Jamie, I know you lingered a little bit on 14 when you were at Barclays in September.</p> <p>But at the end of the day, it feels like for your -- for the portfolio managers that own JPMorgan through the cycle, this Basel III end game really harm your natural earnings power and returns.</p><p><strong>Jeremy Barnum</strong> -- <em>Chief Financial Officer</em></p> <p>Yeah. OK. That's a good question, Erika. I think there's a couple of pieces in there.</p> <p>So let me take the most important piece first, which is the 17% through the cycle target. Are we keeping that or not in light of the Basel III Endgame proposal. So short answer is we're not going to change that number today. But when you look at what we've disclosed about a 25% increase in capital, it's not -- you have to start by acknowledging that, that is a major headwind to returns.</p> <p>In simple terms, you talk about earnings power and returns, but they're two different things, right? We have to be a little bit pedantic and do numerator, denominator here. OK. So say the numerator doesn't change, if you just dilute down the numerator by the increased capital, that's a significantly lower return number. I would say that that's probably the lower bound in terms of the impact of the Basel III Endgame for a couple of reasons.</p> <p>One is we are hoping for changes. Two is once the rule is final, we will seek to reprice in the places where we can. And that will be different in consumer and in wholesale. Some of it will be product level, some of it will be relationship level.</p> <p>But that hopefully can mitigate some of it. But of course, the flip side of that is that's cost getting passed into the real economy, and that's part of the point that we've made about lowering availability of products and services and lending. There may be some opportunities for costless optimization. I'm personally a little bit more pessimistic about those, but we surprised ourselves on those points in the past.</p> <p>So we'll see. And then finally, yes, we may stop doing certain things, and we may exit things. But I wouldn't necessarily assume that, that's going to do a lot to preserve returns at the 17%. That's going to be about exiting things that are shareholder-disruptive but not necessarily producing much higher returns if you know what I mean.</p> <p>So that's that. And then the other part of your question implicitly was talking about organic capital generation, and I think it's just very important to separate impacts on the economy and impacts on long-term returns from our ability to meet the requirements. Of course, as Jamie always says, JPMorgan is going to be fine. And we're building a lot of capital, and we were managing capital conservatively.</p> <p>And we'll be able to build the necessary capital in order to achieve on time or early compliance, which is always what we strive to do. But that doesn't really have any particular bearing on the question of what the long-term return target is or the impact on the real economy.</p><p><strong>Erika Najarian</strong> -- <em>UBS -- Analyst</em></p> <p>Got it. Thank you.</p><p><strong>Operator</strong></p><p>Thank you. Our next question comes from Glenn Schorr with Evercore ISI. You may proceed.</p><p><strong>Glenn Schorr</strong> -- <em>Evercore ISI -- Analyst</em></p> <p>Hi. Thank you. So I very much appreciate the comments in the release on the big picture things of what's going on in the world and the potential impact on markets on crude market, global trade, everything that you mentioned. Sadly agree about the most dangerous time in decades.</p> <p>The question I have is, does it surprise you that markets are heading in that you yourself have green shoots or still green shoots type of mindset about banking while that's going on? And then maybe more importantly, if you believe what -- obviously, what you wrote, what are you doing about it? How do you manage yourself conservatively? How do you prepare for tougher times?</p><p><strong>Jamie Dimon</strong> -- <em>Chairman and Chief Executive Officer</em></p> <p>Yeah. Go ahead, Jeremy. Do you want to start?</p><p><strong>Jeremy Barnum</strong> -- <em>Chief Financial Officer</em></p> <p>OK. So I mean, on green shoots, you'll just note that our comments are cautious. I mean, there is momentum. I do think we are a little bit more optimistic than we were.</p> <p>But obviously, markets have been bumpy, both equity markets and rate markets have been very whippy recently. So we don't want to get too carried away with optimism here. We are coming off a very low base. And so there's a hope and an expectation that we are on the path to normalization and improvement.</p> <p>And of course, the overall economic picture, at least currently, looks solid. The sort of immaculate disinflation trade is actually happening. So those are all reasons to be a little bit optimistic in the near term, but it's tempered with quite a bit of caution.</p><p><strong>Jamie Dimon</strong> -- <em>Chairman and Chief Executive Officer</em></p> <p>I would add question, there has been an extraordinary amount of fiscal monetary stimulus still in the system. And you can't look at -- and of course, it can drive markets and sentiment and sales and profits and all that, but it can't stay like this forever. Between Q2, which you've never had and how much the fiscal stimulus is going to continue at this rate before you have kind of the crowding out kind of factors. So I just -- I think you have to be very cautious.</p> <p>And of course, the dealer policies, I think, is just an extraordinary issue we have to deal with. How do you prepare the company for that? We do 100 stress tests a week. And we do multiple views of it, including geopolitical problems or interest rate problems. But usually, geopolitics presents itself as usually as a deep recession or a mild recession, a recession part of the world or markets going down a lot.</p> <p>And because markets do well is not a reason ever to say they're going to continue to do well. If you don't believe me, remember 1987, 1990, 1994, the year 2000, the year 2009, and people don't predict those inflection points. I just -- but my caution is that we are facing so many uncertainties out there. You're just going to be very cautious where you're facing and like I said, the other thing about the green shoots regardless of that, we try to run the company so that we serve the clients day in and day out with better products and better services, securely, safely and all those things.</p> <p>And that's the ultimate goal. We know there are going to be bad times. That's not a surprise as there are going to be bad times. I don't know how they're coming and where they're coming from, but we keep on serving clients and doing good for clients, you can build a good business kind of separate from what it does to your returns.</p> <p>That's a slightly different issue at this point. But we'll deal with that, too, when we figure out what to do.</p><p><strong>Glenn Schorr</strong> -- <em>Evercore ISI -- Analyst</em></p> <p>Thank you for all that.</p><p><strong>Jamie Dimon</strong> -- <em>Chairman and Chief Executive Officer</em></p> <p>Thanks, Glenn.</p><p><strong>Operator</strong></p><p>Thank you, Our next question comes from Mike Mayo with Wells Fargo Securities. You may proceed.</p><p><strong>Mike Mayo</strong> -- <em>Wells Fargo Securities -- Analyst</em></p> <p>Hi. I understand the NII strategy benefited from First Republic asset sensitivity, TD strategy, money in motion. And I'm curious to how much is the NII increase and the deposit benefits a function of the 67 million digital banking customers. Do you have more digital banking customers and branch customers now? If you can just refresh that? And then a more general question, I guess, the first one for Jeremy, and the second one for Jamie.</p> <p>You have record tech spend. What's the benefit of having record tech spend? If you can kind of mark to market your thoughts there as it relates to AI as it relates to maybe weighted spending, your outlook for next year? And does it really help to be the biggest tech spender of the banking industry?</p><p><strong>Jeremy Barnum</strong> -- <em>Chief Financial Officer</em></p> <p>Yes. Let me do digital banking, Mike. I spent some time on this actually a couple of weeks ago. And it's interesting to note the sort of extent to which the growth in digitally engaged consumers is higher than the overall growth in consumer accounts, meaning that we're continuing to increase the percentage of our consumers that are digitally engaged.</p> <p>And it sort of goes back to my prior point about --</p><p><strong>Jamie Dimon</strong> -- <em>Chairman and Chief Executive Officer</em></p> <p>The percent who are digital only is much lower than that.</p><p><strong>Jeremy Barnum</strong> -- <em>Chief Financial Officer</em></p> <p>For sure, for sure, which actually links to the broader point that what -- in terms of your question about how much is this helping the current NII story, it goes to the larger point of it holistic, through the cycle, multichannel, fully engaged customer strategy, which requires a lot of investment in branches, obviously, but also in digital services of all sorts. So in many ways, you can see the current environment as a little bit of a payoff of that investment, but that's not like, therefore, we stop investing, obviously. So I guess that's part of the answer. And I guess, your other question is the benefits of being the biggest tech spender.</p> <p>I just think like it's sort of mandatory, right? I mean, we're big and very technology-centric business, and the world is competitive. And everything is changing. Younger generations have different expectations, and we have to be nimble, and we have to be on our front foot. And otherwise, we risk getting severely disrupted.</p> <p>So I don't know if Jamie wants to add anything.</p><p><strong>Jamie Dimon</strong> -- <em>Chairman and Chief Executive Officer</em></p> <p>Just the competition, we look at it is it's Wells. It was coming back, which I'm happy for you guys. It's obviously, Marcus, it's Apple. It's Chime, it's Dave.</p> <p>It's -- a lot of people coming up with these businesses in different ways. Some have been quite successful. It's Stripe in payments. And so we want to be very good and very competitive.</p> <p>Some of that tech spending is things which are almost [Inaudible] which is cybersecurity, data center resiliency, regulatory requirements, and things like that, which we simply are going to do and be very, very good at to protect the company.</p><p><strong>Mike Mayo</strong> -- <em>Wells Fargo Securities -- Analyst</em></p> <p>As it relates to AI specifically, which is the talk of the town, I guess the consensus among people outside the banking industry is that banks will not win that battle, including JPMorgan. You won't control the front end. What are you doing with AI to make a difference now? Or is this simply a moonshot?</p><p><strong>Jamie Dimon</strong> -- <em>Chairman and Chief Executive Officer</em></p> <p>Well, I don't agree with that statement. Banks have an extraordinary amount of proprietary data in addition to when you do like a large language model, that's public data. It's looking at everything in the Internet or everything that's ever been published or something like that. But AI is an extraordinarily good tool to use.</p> <p>We just put a woman who is running at our table. So it's data analytics, AI, etc. And there are multiple types of AI. So we use AI for risk, broad marketing, prospecting.</p> <p>And the management team is getting better and better and say, how can we use data to do a better job to reduce errors, to serve clients better, to have a salesperson have copilots. They know why even the clients calling us something like that. And so we simply have to do it. Does it create opportunity for disruptors to come in? Yes, of course.</p> <p>that's always been true with technology and -- but we'll be quite good at it.</p><p><strong>Mike Mayo</strong> -- <em>Wells Fargo Securities -- Analyst</em></p> <p>And then lastly, I think you had made a mention at a conference about investment spend or tech spend over the next year. Where do you stand on that?</p><p><strong>Jeremy Barnum</strong> -- <em>Chief Financial Officer</em></p> <p>Yes. No, because you did ask a little bit about the expense outlook for next year. So I think at the conference, we said I think the consensus was $88 billion, but we're still going through budget process, etc., etc. So that's still true.</p> <p>I think we're still kind of in the ballpark, but I would say at the margin, there's going to be a little bit of upward --</p><p><strong>Jamie Dimon</strong> -- <em>Chairman and Chief Executive Officer</em></p> <p>First Republic, too, or no?</p><p><strong>Jeremy Barnum</strong> -- <em>Chief Financial Officer</em></p> <p>That's all now including First Republic. And I think there'll be a little bit of upward pressure on that as we sort of do our usual thing and look at all the opportunities that we see and the investments that we want to make. So no surprise in that sense that we're going to invest prudently. Nothing dramatic, but probably a little bit of upward pressure on the margin.</p><p><strong>Mike Mayo</strong> -- <em>Wells Fargo Securities -- Analyst</em></p> <p>All right. Thank you</p><p><strong>Operator</strong></p><p>Thank you. Our next question comes from Jim Mitchell with Seaport Global. You may proceed.</p><p><strong>Jim Mitchell</strong> -- <em>Seaport Global Securities -- Analyst</em></p> <p>Hey. Good morning. Jeremy, do you think there's any receptivity among regulators regarding the double counting, not only of operational risk, but I think you alluded to this earlier in the Markets business, but there's clearly double counting and market risk in the trading book. Is there any receptivity?</p><p><strong>Jamie Dimon</strong> -- <em>Chairman and Chief Executive Officer</em></p> <p>Can I just answer real quickly? We don't really know. It's a one side of the conversation generally. They say put in your comments. So everyone's going to put in extensive comments kind of like you heard from Jeremy, and we don't really know.</p> <p>We don't really know what's going on inside the Fed, how many people get involved. My view it's become a very politicized process as opposed to the technical analysis, I think, is required to do it exactly right. So we'll see.</p><p><strong>Jim Mitchell</strong> -- <em>Seaport Global Securities -- Analyst</em></p> <p>OK. And then if it weren't to change, and you talked about the potential impact on liquidity in the Markets business, specifically. Is that a JPM pulling out of certain business type of event? Or is that -- is it more a comment that there'll be fewer providers of liquidity as less-scaled players exit? And maybe that's all else equal, a market share gain opportunity for JPMorgan in a smaller business?</p><p><strong>Jamie Dimon</strong> -- <em>Chairman and Chief Executive Officer</em></p> <p>I think -- so if you look at Markets alone, it's a huge, I think, 60% increase in capital. And if you look at it, you can do that by product for some products and for others. But generally, it's across all products. And market make-- but the really important thing is market making is a critical function.</p> <p>and if you look at the world, only so many large market makers who can make markets for governments, hospitals, cities, schools, states, IMF, World Bank, BlackRock, Blackstone, and all those various things to buy and sell for their clients in size, and market makers have a different function than hedge funds. And I don't know what the real intent was, but this is another one, I think, needs to be really thought through. What are you trying to accomplish? We do market making quite safe. We've never lost the kind of money that people talk about in market making in the global market shock or something like that.</p> <p>But the other thing about market making, I do agree it could actually force some people out. It will force lower positions, which is why I think it's a little risky, but it may also force more consolidation. And so clients since they need it so much, there may be consolidation in unintended way in market making and obviously more volatile markets because with all the constraints for the LCR, SLR, capital, etc, you will constantly be up against limitations on what you can do.</p><p><strong>Jeremy Barnum</strong> -- <em>Chief Financial Officer</em></p> <p>Yeah. And I think that last point of Jamie's is particularly important because sure, if you want, you can construct as what I would consider a very optimistic argument that the higher cost of doing business will lead smaller-scale players to exit, and that's a share gain opportunity for us. But I refer back to the comments about the disincentives to beneficial diversification and scale. Getting bigger, especially in Markets, it's quite expensive from, for example, a GSIB perspective.</p> <p>And so you wind up kind of hemmed in on all sides, which is one of the reasons why we're sort of highlighting that it does seem like the only way out sometimes when you look at the cumulative effect of everything that's happened in markets over the last 15 years is a fundamentally very different system. And well, obviously --</p><p><strong>Jamie Dimon</strong> -- <em>Chairman and Chief Executive Officer</em></p> <p>Great opportunity for European market makers. I mean, a great opportunity. Like they can do repo and FX and swaps and credit and stuff with 30% less capital. That is a big difference in that kind of business.</p><p><strong>Jim Mitchell</strong> -- <em>Seaport Global Securities -- Analyst</em></p> <p>Right. That's helpful. Thanks.</p><p><strong>Operator</strong></p><p>Thank you. Our last question comes from Matt O'Connor -- excuse me, with Deutsche Bank. Your line is open.</p><p><strong>Matt O'Connor</strong> -- <em>Deutsche Bank -- Analyst</em></p> <p>All right. Good morning. You talked about increased spend in some areas in response to an earlier question, but just how do you think about cost control overall looking at the medium term? The outlook for revenue is obviously pressure at least on net interest income, a few might help. But the backdrop is for potentially declining revenue or at least flattish revenue for a couple of few years.</p> <p>So I know you always say you want to invest for the cycle, and it's really paid off over time, but how are you thinking about cost control in the next few years?</p><p><strong>Jeremy Barnum</strong> -- <em>Chief Financial Officer</em></p> <p>Yeah. I mean, I wish I had sort of an answer that fit better into your framework, but in some fundamental sense, we just don't agree with the framework in the sense that -- and we've been through this over the last couple of years, right? In a world where rates drop very suddenly and recover like quite dramatically and credit becomes abnormally good and then rebounds, and you see these very significant fluctuations in capital markets. We saw that 2021 going into 2022 where the revenue environment can change a lot in the short term for reasons that can be largely out of your control. And while, of course, there are parts of our expense base, which are in the short term, directly sensitive to the revenue environment, and some of those adjust naturally, and some of them we adjust more forcefully as a function of volumes.</p> <p>But other things are more structural. And the goal is to make sure that those other things are sized appropriately to what we believe sustainable through cycle returns are. So we're always very focused on cost. You can be rest assured of that.</p> <p>That discipline internally is as aggressive as ever as we go through the budget cycle, but they're long-term plays. And you really shouldn't expect us to see trying to generate cosmetically lower cost in response to a lower revenue environment, where we didn't balloon the cost when the revenue became, as we've argued, unsustainably high.</p><p><strong>Matt O'Connor</strong> -- <em>Deutsche Bank -- Analyst</em></p> <p>Yes. Fair enough. And then if I could just squeeze in on First Republic. Obviously, the contribution there is coming in at multiples higher than expected.</p> <p>How do you think about the puts and takes in terms of -- I think there's probably some runoff of loans still to come, but also opportunities to deepen the relationships there?</p><p><strong>Jeremy Barnum</strong> -- <em>Chief Financial Officer</em></p> <p>Yeah. So you're right about the contribution about the runoff of loans that it is notable the net income, the First Republic-related net income that we printed this quarter. So the first thing to say is that we don't think that, that First Republic-related net income number from this quarter is a sustainable indicator of the future run rate. Some of the same dynamics that we just talked about, in particular, overearning on deposits or sort of above-normal deposit margins also apply to First Republic franchise to some degree.</p> <p>So we would expect that to normalize. And probably more significantly, as I think you alluded to, we do have some accelerated pull to par on some of the commitments that we took on at a fair value discount as part of the acquisition. And so that's a short-term tailwind in the revenue that will come out of that over the next few quarters. And yes, in terms of how it's going overall and deepening the relationships, that remains a focus.</p> <p>And I think more of that will happen as we continue the integration and we continue stabilizing. And yes, I think, as I said, I think, on the press call, things are going well, arguably a little bit better than we had sort of modeled as part of the acquisition, and we're happy to see that.</p><p><strong>Matt O'Connor</strong> -- <em>Deutsche Bank -- Analyst</em></p> <p>Thank you very much.</p><p><strong>Operator</strong></p><p>Thank you. There are no further questions.</p><p><strong>Jamie Dimon</strong> -- <em>Chairman and Chief Executive Officer</em></p> <p>Thank you very much.</p><p><strong>Operator</strong></p><p>[Operator signoff]</p> <p><strong>Duration: 0 minutes</strong></p><h2>Call participants:</h2><p><strong>Jamie Dimon</strong> -- <em>Chairman and Chief Executive Officer</em></p><p><strong>Jeremy Barnum</strong> -- <em>Chief Financial Officer</em></p><p><strong>John McDonald</strong> -- <em>Autonomous Research -- Analyst</em></p><p><strong>Steven Chubak</strong> -- <em>Wolfe Research -- Analyst</em></p><p><strong>Ebrahim Poonawala</strong> -- <em>Bank of America Merrill Lynch -- Analyst</em></p><p><strong>Ryan Kenny</strong> -- <em>Morgan Stanley -- Analyst</em></p><p><strong>Gerard Cassidy</strong> -- <em>RBC Capital Markets -- Analyst</em></p><p><strong>Erika Najarian</strong> -- <em>UBS -- Analyst</em></p><p><strong>Glenn Schorr</strong> -- <em>Evercore ISI -- Analyst</em></p><p><strong>Mike Mayo</strong> -- <em>Wells Fargo Securities -- Analyst</em></p><p><strong>Jim Mitchell</strong> -- <em>Seaport Global Securities -- Analyst</em></p><p><strong>Matt O'Connor</strong> -- <em>Deutsche Bank -- Analyst</em></p>\n",

      "    Operator Good morning, ladies and gentlemen. Welcome to JPMorgan Chase's third-quarter 2023 earnings call. This call is being recorded. [Operator instructions] At this time, I would like to turn the call over to JPMorgan Chase's chief financial officer, Jeremy Barnum; and their chairman and CEO, Jamie Dimon.   Mr. Dimon, please go ahead. Jamie Dimon  --  Chairman and Chief Executive Officer   Good morning, everybody. Before we start the actual call, I want to repeat something we just said on the press call. So before we get into discussions about third-quarter earnings, I just want to say how deeply saddened that we all are about the recent horrific attacks on Israel and the resulting bloodshed and more. Terrorism and hatred have no place in our civilized world, and all of our hearts here at JPMorgan Chase go out to all who are suffering. 10 stocks we like better than JPMorgan Chase When o ur analyst team has  a stock tip, it can pay to listen. After all, the newsletter they have run for over a decade,  Motley Fool Stock Advisor , has tripled the market.*  \n",
      " They just revealed what they believe are the  ten best stocks  for investors to buy right now... and JPMorgan Chase wasn't one of them! That's right -- they think these 10 stocks are even better buys. \n",
      " See the 10 stocks \n",
      " *Stock Advisor returns as of October 13, 2023 Jeremy Barnum  --  Chief Financial Officer   Thanks, Jamie. And of course, I very much echo the sentiment. Now let's turn to our third quarter earnings results. The presentation is available on our website, and please refer to the disclaimer in the back.   Starting on Page 1. The firm reported net income of $13.2 billion, EPS of $4.33 on revenue of $40.7 billion, and delivered an ROTCE of 22%. These results included $669 million of net investment securities losses in Corporate and $665 million of firmwide legal expense. On Page 2, we have some more detail.   Similar to last quarter, we have called out the impact of First Republic where relevant. For this quarter, First Republic contributed $2.2 billion of revenue, $858 million of expense, and $1.1 billion of net income. Now focusing on the firmwide results, excluding First Republic, revenue of $38.5 billion was up $5 billion or 15% year on year. NII ex markets was up $4.8 billion or 28% driven by higher rates and higher revolving balance card, partially offset by lower deposit balances.   NIR ex-markets was up $374 million or 4%, which included lower net investment securities losses than the prior year. End market revenue was down $190 million or 3% year on year. Expenses of $20.9 billion were up $1.7 billion or 9% year on year primarily driven by ongoing growth in front office and technology staffing as well as wage inflation and higher legal expense. And credit costs were $1.4 billion predominantly driven by net charge-offs in card and included a $102 million net reserve release driven by changes in the central scenario, primarily offset by card loan growth.   On to balance sheet and capital on Page 3. We ended the quarter with a CET1 ratio of 14.3%, up about 50 basis points versus the prior quarter as the benefit of net income less capital distributions was partially offset by AOCI. We had $2 billion of net share repurchases this quarter, and the pace of buybacks will likely remain modest in light of the Basel III Endgame proposal. In line with our capital hierarchy, we'll continue to reassess the buyback trajectory as circumstances evolve or opportunities emerge.   And on the topic of the Basel III Endgame, you'll see that we added a couple of pages on it. So let's cover that now, starting on Page 4. Given the significance of this proposal for us, the broader industry as well as households and businesses as end users, we thought it was important to spend time discussing it. And while we know the interest in having us quantify the expected impact of this proposal in a lot of granular detail, it's important to start by asking why the proposed increase is so large, given the repeated statement over time by policymakers that banks are well capitalized and well-positioned to deal with stress.   Given that context, the absence of detailed analysis supporting a capital increase of this magnitude is disconcerting, and there's a lot that does not make sense to us. Starting with RWA. We've already said we expect the firm's RWA to increase by around 30% or $500 billion, which results in capital requirements increasing by about 25% or $50 billion. One immediate thing to point out is that at 4.5% GSIB, a $500 billion increase in RWA requires $22.5 billion of additional capital with no change in our systemic risk footprint.   We've been on the record for a long time that GSIB was conceptually flawed and miscalibrated originally. Since implementation, the failure to address economic growth despite the Fed themselves acknowledging this problem at the outset has made matters worse. And now all of those problems are being applied to an additional $500 billion of RWA. Our view is that the combined proposals could have adjusted the surcharge levels to keep dollars of capital associated with the GSIB buffer constant rather than simply multiplying the RWA increase by the existing surcharges.   Another lens on the proposed increases is the introduction of RWA for operational risk and its clear overlap with op risk losses already capitalized through the stress capital buffer. Although there is limited disclosure from the Fed on this point, we have estimated that we have about $15 billion of operational risk capital embedded in the SCB based on the information the Fed does disclose. Once we capitalize for this new op risk RWA, our required capital will go up by around $30 billion without any change to our portfolio. Now let's turn to Page 5, which shows the impact of the actual and proposed capital rules over the last few years.   Zooming out from the details of this most recent proposal, this page reminds us of what's happened since 2017. Since then, SACR and the stress capital buffer have been adopted and our GSIB surcharge will increase to 4.5%. So assuming the Basel III Endgame and GSIB proposals are finalized in their current form, we would see a 45% increase in our capital requirements relative to that 2017 starting point. This illustrates again how overcalibrated these proposals are, and it's not done yet.   We still expect the Fed to incorporate CECL into CCAR, which will likely increase the SCB. And of course, given the absence of effect to the GSIB flaws, it continues to present a headwind into the indefinite future. And aside from those dynamics, there remains the long-standing issue of procyclicality in the overall capital reform. We think it's also important to point out that the agencies did actually have a choice here.   While it may technically be true that the proposal is Basel-compliant, Basel compliance does not mandate a 25% increase in capital requirements. Implementing the Basel III end game consistently with how the Europeans have by retaining credit risk modeling and also addressing the compounding effects of GSIB and SCB would have achieved Basel compliance without creating this unnecessary increase in capital requirements. As you would expect, we will continue to engage and forcefully advocate during the comment period and beyond in a great deal of technical detail. For the purposes of this call, we wanted to make the equally important broader plans about both the level of capital increase and the flaws in the construct of the framework itself since coherent design is critical to the framework's durability over time.   The current proposal exacerbates existing features to discourage beneficial scale and diversification. If it goes through as written, there will likely be significant impacts on pricing and availability of credit for businesses and consumers. In addition, the ongoing and persistent increase in the regulatory cost of market-making for banks suggest that the regulators want dramatic changes to the current operation of the U.S. capital markets.   We believe that well-regulated market makers that are committed to deploying capital to clients on a principal basis are a critical building block supporting the breadth, depth, and resilience of the American capital markets, which is vital to the U.S. economy. So caution is warranted when proposing changes of this magnitude. With that, we go to our businesses, starting with CCB on Page 6.   Consumer spend growth has now reverted to pre-pandemic trends with nominal spend for customer stable and relatively flat year on year. Cash buffers continue to normalize to pre-pandemic levels with lower income groups normalizing faster. Turning now to the financial results, excluding First Republic. CCB reported net income of $5.3 billion on revenue of $17 billion, which was up 19% year on year.   In Banking and Wealth Management, revenue was up 30% year on year driven by higher NII on higher rates. End-of-period deposits were down 3% quarter on quarter. We ranked No. 1 in retail deposit share based on FDIC data and continue to solidify our leadership position in key markets.   Client investment assets were up 21% year on year driven by market performance and strong net inflows as we continue to capture yield-seeking flows from our Consumer Banking customers. In Home Lending, revenue was down 2% year on year, given a smaller market. Originations of $10.3 billion were up slightly quarter on quarter, but they remained down 15% year on year. Moving to Card Services & Auto.   Revenue was up 7% year on year driven by higher Card Services NII on higher revolving balances, partially offset by lower auto lease income. Card outstandings were up 16% year on year due to strong account acquisition and continued normalization of revolve. And then auto originations were $10.2 billion, up 36% year on year as we saw competitors pull back and we gained market share. Expenses of $8.5 billion were up 7% year on year largely driven by continued investments in staffing, primarily in front office and technology.   In terms of credit performance this quarter, credit costs were $1.4 billion driven by net charge-offs, which were up $720 million year on year predominantly due to continued normalization of card. The net reserve build of $49 million reflected a $301 million build in Card Services, primarily offset by a $250 million release in Home Lending. Next, the CIB on Page 7. CIB reported net income of $3.1 billion on revenue of $11.7 billion.   Investment Banking revenue of $1.6 billion was down 6% year on year. IB fees were down 3% year on year, and we ranked No. 1 with a year-to-date wallet share of 8.6%. In advisory, fees were down 10%.   Underwriting fees were up 8% for debt and down 6% for equity. In terms of the outlook, we're encouraged by the level of capital markets activity in September, and we have a healthy pipeline going into the fourth quarter. Advisory has also picked up compared to the first half, but year-to-date announced M&A remains down significantly, which will continue to be a headwind. Payments revenue was $2.1 billion, up 3% year on year.   Excluding equity investments, it was up 12% driven by higher rates, partially offset by lower deposit balances. Moving to Markets. Total revenue was $6.6 billion, down 3% year on year against a very strong third quarter last year. Fixed income was up 1% driven by an increase in financing and trade activity and securitized products as well as improved performance in credit.   This was predominantly offset by Currencies and emerging Markets coming off a very strong quarter last year. Equity Markets was down 10%, reflecting lower revenues across products compared to a strong prior-year quarter as activity was challenged by lower volatility. Securities Services revenue of $1.2 billion was up 9% year on year driven by higher rates, partially offset by lower deposit balances. Expenses of $7.4 billion were up 11% year on year predominantly driven by higher legal expense and wage inflation.   Credit costs were a net benefit of $185 million driven by a net reserve release of $230 million, reflecting the impact of net lending activity and net charge-offs of $45 million. Moving to the Commercial Bank on Page 8. Commercial Banking reported net income of $1.7 billion. Revenue of $3.7 billion was up 20% year on year with payments revenue of $2 billion, up 30% year on year driven by higher rates and gross Investment Banking and Markets revenue of $821 million was up 8% year on year, reflecting increased M&A volume.   Expenses of $1.4 billion were up 15% year on year largely driven by an increase in headcount, including front office and technology investments as well as higher volume-related expense, including the impact of new client acquisition. Average deposits were down 7% year on year and 5% quarter on quarter primarily driven by lower nonoperating deposits as clients opt for higher-yielding alternatives. Loans were up 1% quarter on quarter. C&I loans were flat, reflecting continued stabilization in new loan demand and revolver utilization.   And CRE loans were up 1%, reflecting funding of prior year originations in real estate banking as well as lower payoff activity. Finally, credit costs were $64 million, including net charge-offs of $50 million and a net reserve build of $14 million. Then to complete our lines of business, AWM on Page 9. Asset and Wealth Management reported net income of $1.1 billion with a pre-tax margin of 31%.   Revenue of $4.6 billion was relatively flat year on year as higher management fees on strong net inflows and higher average market levels were offset by lower performance fees and lower NII from deposits. Expenses of $3.1 billion were up 3% year on year driven by continued growth in our private banking advisory teams and the impact of closing the JPMorgan Asset Management China and global shares acquisitions. For the quarter, net long-term inflows were $20 billion, positive across all asset classes led by equities. And in liquidity, we saw net inflows of $40 billion.   AUM of $3.2 trillion was up 22% year on year, and client assets of $4.6 trillion were up 21% year on year driven by continued net inflows of higher-margin levels. Finally, loans were flat quarter on quarter, while deposits were down 5% driven by migration to investments, partially offset by client inflows. Turning to Corporate on Page 10. Corporate reported net income of $911 million.   Revenue was $1.5 billion, up $1.8 billion compared to last year. NII was $2 billion, up $1.2 billion year on year due to the impact of higher rates. And NIR was a net loss of $506 million and included the net investment securities losses I mentioned upfront. Expenses of $456 million were up $151 million year on year.   To finish, we have the outlook on Page 11. We now expect 2023 NII and NII ex markets to be approximately $88.5 billion and $89 billion, respectively, with the increase driven by slower reprice than previously assumed. Consistent with what we've been saying throughout the year, while we don't know when it will normalize, we do not consider this level of NII to be sustainable. Our outlook for 2023 adjusted expense is now approximately $84 billion.   And as a reminder, this is on an adjusted basis, which excludes legal expense. Also, remember this outlook excludes the pending FDIC special assessment. On credit, we now expect the 2023 card net charge-off rate to be approximately 2.5% mostly driven by denominator effects due to recent balance growth. So to wrap up, we're pleased with another quarter of strong operating results.   Throughout the year, we've been pointing out the various sources of significant uncertainty. And all of those, including the geopolitical situation, economic outlook, rate environment, deposit reprice and the impact of the Basel III Endgame proposal are as prominent now as they have been in the recent past. But as always, we continue to prepare for a range of scenarios and are focused on being there for our clients and customers when they need us most. And with that, let's open the line for Q&A.  \n"

And with that, I'll turn the call over to Ed. </p><p><strong>Ed Bastian</strong> -- <em>Chief Executive Officer</em></p><div class=\"interad\"></div> <p>Well, thank you, Julie, and good morning, everyone. We appreciate you joining us. Before we start, I want to acknowledge the unfolding war in Israel and the tragic loss of life that has ensued. Delta is donating $1 million to the American Red Cross for the International Committee of the Red Cross to help fund humanitarian efforts in the conflict.</p> <p>This includes emergency assistance such as health services, emergency care, ambulance services, and other critical needs. Our inbound and outbound flights to Tel Aviv have been suspended through October 31 to ensure the safety and security of our customers and employees. We're also offering a customer waiver for travel to Tel Aviv for those who need to change their travel plans. Our hearts are with everyone impacted by these tragic and horrific events.</p> <p>Turning to our news for the day. This morning, Delta reported September quarter results, posting earnings of $2.03 per share, a 35% increase over last year. Revenue grew 13% and we achieved a 13.5% operating margin. This resulted in operating income of $2 billion, bringing our operating profit over the last 12 months to over $6 billion.</p> <p>The Delta people delivered for our customers throughout the very busy summer season, and I'm grateful to our teams for all they do for our customers and each other every day. Our people are the foundation of Delta and are our most important competitive strength. Sharing our financial success with our people is a long-standing pillar of Delta's culture. With this quarter's financial performance, we accrued another $420 million toward next February's profit sharing.</p><div class=\"interad\"></div> <p>This brings our profit-sharing accrual to over $1 billion year to date, marking an important and exciting milestone for the Delta team. The great work of our 100,000 people was recently recognized as Delta ranked No. 12 overall on Time Magazine's list of The World's Best Companies. We were the only airline to make the top 100 of this prestigious list.</p> <p>And USA Today readers just selected Delta as the Best Airline in the World. Our operational fundamentals remain strong, underscored by Delta's industry-leading position in on-time arrivals and blue sky operational performance that is reliably back to pre-COVID levels. Following a high number of irregular operations days early in the quarter driven by weather and ATC constraints, we have seen consistent improvement in our operating metrics. In October, we are running a near-perfect completion factor across the mainline system, and we remain No.</p> <p>1 in on-time arrivals year to date. As we're now in the final phase of our recovery, we are making important forward-leaning investments in the health and reliability of our fleet. These maintenance investments will position us to consistently deliver the operational excellence that underpins Delta's brand. Running a high-quality operation is critical to being the airline of choice for our customers and driving a competitive cost structure.</p> <p>Dan will speak more to this shortly. During the quarter, we also made a $150 million strategic investment in Wheels Up, co-investing alongside Certares Management, Knighthead Capital, and others. This new investment structure combines the No. 1 premium commercial airline with the travel and tourism expertise of Certares and the turnaround expertise of Knighthead.</p> <p>Delta's relationship with Wheels Up creates a new premium product line for our customers, and I look forward to working with our co-investors and the new management team to unlock the full value of this uniquely positioned business. Turning to our outlook. Travel remains a top purchase priority and our core customer base is in a healthy financial position. We continue to see strength in bookings across Delta's global network, driven by our consumers.</p> <p>Demand for premium experiences, international travel, and increasing business travel further differentiate the trends that Delta is seeing within the industry. We expect our December quarter revenues to be 10% higher than 2022 with a 10% operating margin and earnings of over $1 per share. This brings our expectation for full-year earnings to over $6 per share on a double-digit operating margin and free cash flow of $2 billion. Since raising full-year guidance over the summer, our revenue outlook has improved, though earnings and cash flow have been impacted by higher fuel and maintenance costs.</p> <p>Revenue for the full year is expected to increase 20% over last year, which was the high end of our expectations on steady domestic demand and continued strength in international. With strong top-line growth and margin expansion, we expect to double earnings year over year and deliver a 13% return on invested capital. Our outlook for 2023 keeps revenue, earnings, cash flow, and debt reduction on track with our three-year plan, which we issued in December of '21. As we progress through the recovery, we have made meaningful investments in operational reliability and our people.</p> <p>Delta has led the industry in setting the bar for wages, including a new pilot deal and profit sharing. We are seeing the structural step-up in operating costs amid increasing fuel prices, creating some near-term pressure on industry margins. However, I fully expect that the market will adjust to higher costs as it has historically and reestablished equilibrium. With Delta's differentiated premium revenue strategy and strong global network, we will continue to deliver industry-leading profitability and generate robust free cash flow.</p> <p>In closing, the strategy that we shared at Investor Day positions us well for the future. And while the environment we operate in continues to evolve in this post-COVID world, our objectives are unchanged as we move into 2024. With our network rebuilt and growth now moderating, optimizing the airline and driving efficiency are significant opportunities. Thank you again for your support of our company.</p> <p>And with that, let me hand it over to Glen and to Dan to go through the details of the quarter.</p><p><strong>Glen Hauenstein</strong> -- <em>President</em></p> <p>Thank you, Ed, and good morning. I want to start by thanking all of our employees for their hard work and dedication during the busy summer travel season. In the September quarter, Delta generated revenue of $14.6 billion, up 13% over prior year. Total unit revenues were down 2.5%, including a point of pressure from cargo and MRO.</p> <p>With these results, I expect Delta to deliver a record September quarter unit revenue premium versus the industry, reflecting the continued success of our commercial strategy. Domestic passenger revenue was up 6% over prior year. Performance was steady through the quarter with strength in our coastal hubs where we are leveraging our leading positions in generational airport bills. International passenger revenue grew 35%, with the transatlantic and Pacific outperforming our already high expectations.</p> <p>We delivered record margins across all international entities this summer and strength is continuing through the fall. Demand for our premium products is very strong with revenue up 17% over prior year, outperforming Main Cabin by five points. Domestic paid load factor in our first-class cabins was a record as we continue to advance our premium merchandising and upsell capabilities. Delta Premium Select has now been rolled out to over 85% of long-haul flights, and the revenue generation from this product has been above expectations and a key contributor to our record international margins.</p> <p>Business travel continues to steadily improve as corporates continue with return-to-office initiatives. Less recovered sectors like technology and financial services saw a double-digit growth during the quarter. A recent corporate survey indicates continued growth in business demand with a significant majority of companies expecting their travel to stay the same or increase as we move into 4Q and into '24. SME and hybrid travelers are producing margins in line with corporate travelers and demand from these travels remains well above 2019 levels.</p> <p>Total loyalty revenue was up 17% over prior year with continued strength in our American Express co-brand portfolio. Amex remuneration of $1.7 billion grew approximately 20% over prior year. We expect full-year remuneration of close to $7 billion and are focused on reaching our long-term goal of $10 billion. Diversified revenue streams, including premium and loyalty have generated 55% of revenue year to date, reflecting Delta's differentiated positioning to the industry.</p> <p>Turning to the December quarter, we expect total unit revenue to grow 9% to 12% over prior year, bringing our full-year revenues to up 20% over prior year. This is at the high end of our guidance even with a few points less capacity than we had planned for the year, reflecting robust demand for the Delta product. Capacity in the fourth quarter is expected to be up 14% to 15%, implying total unit revenues down 2.5% to 4.5% versus prior year. Domestic and transatlantic trends are expected to be consistent with the third quarter.</p> <p>Pacific and Latin America unit revenue trends are expected to be modest -- excuse me, expected to modestly decelerate, given capacity growth related to China reopening and investment in our LATAM JV. Domestic demand remains steady and initial bookings for the peak holiday periods are strong. The ongoing UAW and actor strikes are having a modest impact and we have incorporated those into our outlook. As we move through the fourth quarter, our domestic capacity growth moderates, and in the first quarter of 2024 we expect domestic capacity to be flat to slightly down year over year.</p> <p>We have reallocated capacity to international leisure where we are expecting strong returns and remain focused on fully restoring our higher-margin core hubs. On international, we are seeing continued demand strength through the winter. The transatlantic remains very strong, driven by partner hubs and southern European leisure traffic performance. We're closely monitoring the situation in Israel as we will evaluate restarting the flights as the situation stabilizes.</p> <p>In the Pacific, we expect to grow December quarter capacity 40% to 50% as we continue restoring the network. While this level of growth will impact unit revenue, we expect the new flying will be profit accretive. For the year, we remain confident in finishing strong with record profitability across all three international entities. In closing, I'm proud of the revenue performance our teams have delivered, and I'm confident that our integrated commercial strategy will continue to drive industry-leading profitability.</p> <p>And with that, I'll turn it over to Dan to talk about the financials.</p><p><strong>Dan Janki</strong> -- <em>Chief Financial Officer</em></p> <p>Thank you, Glen, and good morning to everyone. For the September quarter, we delivered earnings of $2.03 per share and operating margin of 13.5%. Nonfuel unit costs were up 1.3% year over year and fuel prices averaged $2.78 a gallon, including a refinery benefit of $0.11. We generated operating cash flow of $1.1 billion and we reinvested $1.4 billion into the business.</p> <p>Liquidity ended the quarter at $7.8 billion and adjusted net debt of $20.2 billion. Year to date, we've repaid $3.7 billion of gross debt. This is including $1.7 billion of accelerated repayments on our higher-cost debt. Our leverage ratio improved to three times on a trailing 12-month basis.</p> <p>During the quarter, S&amp;P upgraded our credit rating to BB+, one notch away from investment grade, a recognition of our improving financial foundation. Our capital allocation priorities are reinvesting in the business and improving our balance sheet to investment-grade metrics with a modest cash return to shareholders through our dividend. Now moving to guidance. For the December quarter, we expect nonfuel unit costs to be flat to up 2% on a year-over-year basis.</p> <p>With the exception of maintenance costs, our second-half unit costs are progressing as expected. As we discussed in September, there are three drivers to higher maintenance: first, investment in fleet health; second, expanded work scope on our 757 engine fleet; and third, challenges across the supply chain. On fleet health and reliability, our investments are starting to deliver improved operational performance. Our September metrics were ahead of August and October is ahead of September.</p> <p>On the 757 engine, a workhorse in our fleet, we're going through a wave of overhauls. The engines we took off-wing over the summer required larger work scope and a higher mix of new parts. Looking forward, we are forecasting higher new material consumption rates. On supply chain, the industry continues to face challenges that will take time to work through.</p> <p>Engine and airframe turnaround times remain elevated, driving inefficiency and impacting productivity. We are working closely with our partners and leveraging our deep expertise in TechOps to manage supply chain challenges. Delta has a long heritage of industry-leading operational performance, driven by the best TechOps capability in the industry. Operational excellence is central to our brand promise and a key pacing item to drive out inefficiencies.</p> <p>Moving to fuel. Fuel prices have moved higher since July, adding roughly $400 million of expense to our outlook for the second half of the year. We expect December fuel prices to be $2.90 to $3.20 per gallon, with the refinery expected to be roughly breakeven for the quarter. The refinery turnaround is progressing as we planned and we expect production to resume in mid-November.</p> <p>Based on our December quarter outlook for revenue and costs, we expect earnings of $1.05 to $1.30 per share on a 9% to 11% operating margin. This brings our full-year outlook to earnings to $6 to $6.25 per share on double-digit operating margin and free cash flow of $2 billion. We are focused on finishing the year strong. We remain committed to delivering industry-leading margin performance, earnings growth, and strong cash generation.</p> <p>As we progress through the 2024 planning process, our focus is shifting from restoration to optimization. Over the last two years, we've grown at an unprecedented rate for an airline of our size to restore our network. Growth is normalizing next year, and we expect operational reliability to continue to improve. This will allow us to optimize how we run the airline, reducing operational buffers and driving out inefficiencies that have resulted from the intensity of the rebuild.</p> <p>Our capacity growth for 2024 will be focused on Delta's areas of strength. Domestically, we are prioritizing our core high-margin hubs, driving connectivity and gauge. Internationally, we are leveraging our best-in-class JV partnerships and increasing the mix of flying on next-generation aircraft. We are executing against the strategy and financial objectives we laid out at our Investor Day, with an emphasis on free cash flow, earnings durability, and capital efficiency.</p> <p>In closing, Delta is well-positioned to maintain industry leadership operationally and financially. I'd like to sincerely thank the Delta people for everything they do every day. With that, I'll turn it back to Julie for Q&amp;A.</p><p><strong>Julie Stewart</strong> -- <em>Vice President, Investor Relations</em></p> <p>Thanks, Dan. Matthew, can you please remind the analysts how to queue up for a question?</p> <h2>Questions &amp; Answers:</h2><br/> <p><strong>Operator</strong></p><p>Certainly [Operator instructions] Your first question is coming from Jamie Baker from J.P. Morgan. Your line is live.</p><p><strong>Jamie Baker</strong> -- <em>JPMorgan Chase and Company -- Analyst</em></p> <p>Hey. Good morning, everybody. So, Dan, expanding on some of your engine comments, we're obviously focused on the GTF situation. I realize you're not -- or at least I don't believe you're directly impacted with any groundings right now.</p> <p>I'm just trying to square the situation against your MRO and your GTF in-house expertise. And is there a scenario where the Pratt mess ends up benefiting Delta? Or should we think more about simply reducing the downside relative to some of your peers? Also, how does this impact the maintenance cost guide embedded in your 2024 CASM expectations?</p><p><strong>Dan Janki</strong> -- <em>Chief Financial Officer</em></p> <p>Maybe first start with the geared turbofan as it relates more directly to our fleet both. On the neo, we took our deliveries later so the impact will be modest to minimal. If there are any inspections or things off-wing, it will be in the latter half of 2024 based on the analysis that we've gotten so far from Pratt. We're still waiting on the full analysis related to the 220 fleet.</p> <p>That should be coming later this month and we will assess that impact appropriately. As it relates to MRO, Pratt is certainly a close partner of ours and an important one as it relates to that third-party capability. And we will certainly support their efforts. We're working closely with them on that.</p> <p>We have capacity that ultimately comes down to the allocation of capacity and availability of material to do the work, but we'll be working with them through fall and into next year on that.</p><p><strong>Jamie Baker</strong> -- <em>JPMorgan Chase and Company -- Analyst</em></p> <p>OK. That's helpful. And then for Glen, I've asked about this before. A lot of Delta customers obviously took fairly lavish European vacations this year.</p> <p>You have SkyMiles data on these folks. What's the correlation between big summer spenders and big winter spenders? What's that, I don't know, sort of SkyMiles Venn diagram look like? Because what I'm wondering about is the potential for people scaling back on their winter trips because they've spent lavishly on their summer holidays. Any actual data you can share on that?</p><p><strong>Glen Hauenstein</strong> -- <em>President</em></p> <p>Sure. I think what we're really excited about is the lengthening of the European travel season. And that has really gone from primarily ending in the summer IATA season, which would be October. Now through November, through the holidays, through the new year, and really, now we're only talking about a six- to eight-week period that are the doldrums for Europe.</p> <p>So the bookings, which most people wouldn't have expected, of course, we reduced our schedule in the fall and the winter IATA season. But our year-over-year comps are actually accelerating into the winter as we look into November, December, and January. So I think we're seeing that continuing into the fall and early parts of winter and we're very excited about that. And we've also, of course, expanded into a lot more Latin leisure this winter than we did last winter, and the advanced demand for that seems very, very robust.</p> <p>So leisure is still very strong and even through shoulder and off-peak periods.</p><p><strong>Jamie Baker</strong> -- <em>JPMorgan Chase and Company -- Analyst</em></p> <p>OK. Thanks, Glen. Thanks, everybody. Take care.</p><p><strong>Operator</strong></p><p>Thank you. Your next question is coming from Savi Syth from Raymond James. Your line is live.</p><p><strong>Savi Syth</strong> -- <em>Raymond James -- Analyst</em></p> <p>Hey. Good morning. If I may, Glen, just your comment about domestic capacity being flat to down in the first quarter. I was just wondering if that was a decent trend for the full year, or it was related to also -- in the last year the way first quarter's kind of turned out wasn't what you expected and you were going to make some capacity changes? So is that related to that as well? Or is it more kind of weakness that you're seeing recently or maybe strength in international on a relative basis?</p><p><strong>Glen Hauenstein</strong> -- <em>President</em></p> <p>It's really a reshaping of the demand patterns that we saw last year. And no shock, January and February are not in the northern tier transcon to East-West markets, barnburner market, so reallocating those to warmer and sunnier places. So our total capacity will be up. Domestic capacity will be down slightly.</p> <p>Core hubs will actually be up with more emphasis on warm and sunny places in Latin America and South Pacific. So that's kind of how we're profiling and really optimization of the demand patterns we saw last year going into this winter.</p><p><strong>Savi Syth</strong> -- <em>Raymond James -- Analyst</em></p> <p>That makes sense. And if I may also just on domestic revenue, you've been stable at Delta since kind of June. I was wondering how much of the contribution you're getting from restoring your hubs and separately perhaps, the domestic portion of international trips, given what you've talked about is the strength kind of continuing in transatlantic longer than kind of historic? The reason I ask is it seems that stable comment is a little bit different than maybe what we're hearing from kind of the purely domestic airlines.</p><p><strong>Glen Hauenstein</strong> -- <em>President</em></p> <p>Right, right. I think what domestic strength is really coming from are the premium products domestically. And I'm not going to speak for the other carriers. They all have coming in the next few weeks.</p> <p>But it really hasn't been on domestic portion of international journey, which is de minimis in terms of the variance to what it was last year. Our employments to -- in the transatlantic are up low double digits, but that only represents 13% of our total travel, so really a de minimis impact to domestic. So it's really coming from the premium products. And they're doing quite well, as I mentioned.</p> <p>Domestic paid first-class load factors are reaching new heights every month. So very excited about those demand trends. And I think that reinforces the strategy we've been working on for the last 10 years to have a differentiated product.</p><p><strong>Savi Syth</strong> -- <em>Raymond James -- Analyst</em></p> <p>Well, thank you.</p><p><strong>Operator</strong></p><p>Thank you. Your next question is coming from Conor Cunningham from Melius Research. Your line is live.</p><p><strong>Conor Cunningham</strong> -- <em>Melius Research -- Analyst</em></p> <p>Thank you, Ed, in the prepared remarks, I think you touched on fuel recapture. Right now, there doesn't seem to be much of an adjustment on the capacity side from some of your indices participants despite, like, erratic fuel. So just trying to understand if there's a new calculus to how you're approaching fuel recapture right now in the current market? Thank you.</p><p><strong>Ed Bastian</strong> -- <em>Chief Executive Officer</em></p> <p>Well, obviously, fuel moved an awful lot within just the last couple of months. And it's the volatility of fuel that really hits us hard as compared to the ability to recapture it. I think traditionally, we've seen over a two- to three-quarter rise. We have a pretty good success rate at recapturing it.</p> <p>And when you think about the strength of the demand environment and the fact that across the board, everyone's not just fuel costs are up, but labor rates are increasing and other inflationary pressure, supply chain, and maintenance costs are up. Everyone has a similar incentive to continue to be able to recalibrate those pricing -- those market pressures into pricing. So my outlook is I'm optimistic as we're going into '24. Glen can add his own color there.</p><p><strong>Glen Hauenstein</strong> -- <em>President</em></p> <p>NoI think you mentioned it really well. It takes time. And when we have rapid fuel price run-ups, it usually takes a few quarters for that to roll into the industry-realized fares. But historically, it's always worked.</p> <p>So we're looking at history to predict the future, but that's what the history would tell you.</p><p><strong>Conor Cunningham</strong> -- <em>Melius Research -- Analyst</em></p> <p>OK. Appreciate that. And then Dan, just back to the maintenance costs and operational investments. Just trying to understand, I know you touched on it in Jamie's question but just trying to understand how it plays out.</p> <p>Are you basically assuming that maintenance and operational investments will be elevated in the first half? And then how does that roll off? And then when do the productivity gains that you've talked about in the past kind of kick in? I'm just trying to understand how that -- the moving parts are changing a little bit right now. Thank you.</p><p><strong>Dan Janki</strong> -- <em>Chief Financial Officer</em></p> <p>Yeah, yeah, certainly talked about it. We're in the middle of -- Conor, thank you. We're in the middle of the '24 planning process. When you think about maintenance, as Ed talked about, it is a foundational item as it relates to our operational reliability and the investments that we're making here were related to fleet help and the work that we're doing on our engines, we're going to stay after here.</p> <p>And that will be with us at least into the first half of next year, and we want to drive that operational reliability. The second part of that is, as you get that operational reliability, that is really what creates the foundation to be able to start to optimize and unlock the cost investment and inefficiencies that we talked back about at Investor Day, that $1 billion-plus. And as you see that operational liability continue to improve, our teams will be able to lean more and more into getting those investment buffers out, those inefficiencies that are in every part of our operation. And our teams are working through that as they're building out their operating plan and financial plan for 2024.</p><p><strong>Conor Cunningham</strong> -- <em>Melius Research -- Analyst</em></p> <p>Thank you.</p><p><strong>Operator</strong></p><p>Thank you. Your next question is coming from Duane Pfennigwerth from Evercore ISI. Your line is live.</p><p><strong>Duane Pfennigwerth</strong> -- <em>Evercore ISI -- Analyst</em></p> <p>Hey. Good morning. Just on the maintenance investment, a follow-up to maybe Jamie's question there. Is this at all a reflection of your thoughts on future aircraft delivery constraints? In other words, were you always thinking about using those 75s next year? And then just generally, how do you think about and measure returns on capital for investing in something like 757 versus going out and buying new?</p><p><strong>Dan Janki</strong> -- <em>Chief Financial Officer</em></p> <p>Yeah. Glen can chime in here, too. I think the 757 has been a fleet as we've gone through our restoration that we've characterized as a flexible fleet, and it's one that it's certainly a workhorse. The returns are very good related to how we deploy it and fly it within our network.</p> <p>So we have leaned on it. When you think back of where we might have been 18, 24 months ago, the number that we're flying, we have reactivated more as we continue to see new delivery slide and we get recalibrated year to year. So it is one that we've leaned into. And it's one that we'll be flexible on as we work through the next three, four, five years in regards to how we deploy it.</p> <p>The wave of overhauls that we started last year and we're doing this year and we'll have the same next year, but that gets us through a heavy wave that then allows us really very viable engines that the Delta team has always been very good at managing the end of life of an asset. We did it on the 90s, 88s in regards to how you manage those assets and deploy them but also get the most out of them, whether it's in whole or in the parts and how they're redeployed back in the stream. And we are always working closely then with fleet and maintenance with Glen's team on how to deploy them and get the best returns for them. But those are good returning -- it's a great workhorse for our fleet with good returns.</p><p><strong>Glen Hauenstein</strong> -- <em>President</em></p> <p>Nothing to add other than we took a lot of late deliveries. I think our last 75 was produced -- we had the last one ever built. So some of these planes are not that old, and we have them in our fleet, and we have -- but as you said, as we get to the end of life of these toward the end of this decade, we'll be able to really start harvesting the engines, which will really improve the maintenance profile of the fleet.</p><p><strong>Ed Bastian</strong> -- <em>Chief Executive Officer</em></p> <p>And Duane, this is Ed, if I could add my perspective. Your point is right. It is related to the OEMs fundamentally. Their inability to produce engines on time, which they're having their own challenges within the supply chain as well as parts on time.</p> <p>And the one thing that has been a core part of Delta's strength over at TechOps is our ability to go into the used repair market and acquire assets and repurpose them toward our own needs. That market has largely dried up, given all the large rebound in flight activity, which was running at the same time the OEMs have been having struggling to produce new. So I think this is something you're going to see across the industry. This isn't just at Delta.</p> <p>And it's one of the constraints we talked about at Investor Day. That's going to keep us all pretty limited in the amount of capacity that we can produce. But I'd put my money on the Delta TechOps team because they're the best in the business and we'll figure this out. And we know this is a -- while it may hit the expense line, we know this is a long-term asset that's going to pay dividends for years to come.</p><p><strong>Duane Pfennigwerth</strong> -- <em>Evercore ISI -- Analyst</em></p> <p>Appreciate those thoughts. And maybe just for my follow-up on Pacific and Glen, can you just remind us where we are in China reopen? I think there's another round of expansion here in November. And then just broadly in Pacific, what are the markets away from China that you're excited about?</p><p><strong>Glen Hauenstein</strong> -- <em>President</em></p> <p>Well, I think what we're very excited about is the success of our Incheon hub with Korean, and that has really even exceeded our expectations. We think it's the best place to connect to get to Southeast Asia from any one of our hubs or as a double connect. So really trying to leverage that, and we'll have some announcements on continuing to work to increase our capacity next year. But that's really been a lynchpin.</p> <p>South Pacific has been a really great surprise for us. The demand there really in tune with that same high demand for leisure destinations. So that's been doing very well as well as Japan. As you know, Japan was closed for a couple of years and our Japanese franchise is doing quite well.</p> <p>So you put the Pacific together, and if you recall, for years, we were telling our investors to hold on. We've got this restructuring coming. We had the wrong airplanes. We were at the wrong airports, and it took us many years to get to where we wanted to be.</p> <p>But we're finally there and we're producing rate returns in the Pacific, and we're excited about our opportunities moving forward.</p><p><strong>Duane Pfennigwerth</strong> -- <em>Evercore ISI -- Analyst</em></p> <p>Appreciate the detailed thoughts.</p><p><strong>Glen Hauenstein</strong> -- <em>President</em></p> <p>China, I didn't say -- China, of course. We went from essentially double daily in Detroit -- double weekly, I'm sorry, in Detroit and Seattle to 10 times a week, with Seattle moving to daily and Detroit moving to three times. And we'll see if there's another wave of this. I think the first thing we have to see is, is there demand for the capacity that's going into market right now? And we'll keep you abreast of that as we move forward on China reopening.</p><p><strong>Duane Pfennigwerth</strong> -- <em>Evercore ISI -- Analyst</em></p> <p>Thank you.</p><p><strong>Operator</strong></p><p>Thank you. Your next question is coming from Andrew Didora from Bank of America. Your line is live.</p><p><strong>Andrew Didora</strong> -- <em>Bank of America Merrill Lynch -- Analyst</em></p> <p>Good morning, everyone. I had a couple of questions. I just kind of want to bring it back to some things discussed at Investor Day. I guess maybe first, just on capacity growth.</p> <p>I know you gave us a little color about how you're thinking about 1Q kind of domestic versus international. But the mid-single-digit growth that you talked about in 2024. I guess in this fuel environment, would you consider that growth rate as reasonable or aspirational at this point in time?</p><p><strong>Ed Bastian</strong> -- <em>Chief Executive Officer</em></p> <p>Well, it's probably more a question for Glen than myself. But at my level, as I just said in my last comments, I hear -- my sense would be any capacity that you hear from us in terms of plan or the industry, you should read as somewhat aspirational because there still are tremendous constraints in the marketplace in terms of delivering that growth. If all goes well and we get all the parts and we get the planes on time, and we have the labor ready and ATC is not an issue and fuel prices stay reasonable, yes, that's what's going to happen. But if you look over the last two to three years, we continue to evolve it.</p> <p>So those are just points in time estimates as to what we could do. As to what we actually will be able to do, I think we'll probably across the board to be a little less than that.</p><p><strong>Glen Hauenstein</strong> -- <em>President</em></p> <p>And I would just add a comment. About half of that is run rate of what's in there as we enter the first quarter of next year. So the real number is half of low single digits, which is very low single digits.</p><p><strong>Andrew Didora</strong> -- <em>Bank of America Merrill Lynch -- Analyst</em></p> <p>Got it. Makes sense. And then I guess, Dan, just on cost and CASM next year. Obviously, with capacity moving around, obviously, the maintenance costs continuing into next year.</p> <p>Can you just give us a sense of your level of confidence in 2024 CASM ex being able to be down kind of low single digits or should we think about that differently as well?</p><p><strong>Dan Janki</strong> -- <em>Chief Financial Officer</em></p> <p>As I mentioned earlier, we're still in the middle of our planning process. So all these pieces are coming together, right, capacity, along with all the things that we've talked about regarding the maintenance, we're spending certainly a lot more time on that, given all the moving pieces in the industry and elements that we talked about.</p><p><strong>Ed Bastian</strong> -- <em>Chief Executive Officer</em></p> <p>Yeah. Dan's comments earlier about this is going to be a pivot to optimization is a big deal. And maintenance is a part of that. Maintenance unlocks the ability to drive the efficiencies across the enterprise.</p> <p>And we're right in the middle of the planning process. So we're not trying to dodge your question. We will give you, at the typical time at the start of the year, what we think we can do.</p><p><strong>Andrew Didora</strong> -- <em>Bank of America Merrill Lynch -- Analyst</em></p> <p>Understood. Thank you.</p><p><strong>Operator</strong></p><p>Thank you. Your next question is coming from Catherine O'Brien from Goldman Sachs. Your line is live.</p><p><strong>Catherine O'Brien</strong> -- <em>Goldman Sachs -- Analyst</em></p> <p>Good morning, everyone. Thanks for the time. Ed, on CNBC this morning, you called out a pickup in corporate bookings. Could we just dig into that a little bit more? What have you seen since Labor Day on volumes or revenue from corporate? Any industries or regions that are bigger drivers or it's really across the board? And anything on maybe corporate booking windows today versus maybe a couple of months ago and they're still longer than pre COVID.</p><p><strong>Ed Bastian</strong> -- <em>Chief Executive Officer</em></p> <p>Well, we said on the last call that we anticipated post Labor Day that we'd see volumes of corporate travel pick up. And indeed, we're seeing that. I think Glen mentioned a couple of sectors. The tech sector and the financial services sector is areas that we're seeing double-digit growth.</p> <p>We have, I'd say across the board, we're seeing increases. Corporate travel, as it's come back, it comes back and then plateaus comes back and plateaus. And I think you'll see another wave of return. I think a lot of it's being driven by the return to office and getting into the new normal work patterns, which many companies are still sorting out for themselves.</p> <p>But it's healthy to see and it's one of the distinguishing factors between us and some of the carriers that are on the other end of the fare spectrum. So one of the many differentiating factors that is enabling us to grow revenues at the pace we are.</p><p><strong>Catherine O'Brien</strong> -- <em>Goldman Sachs -- Analyst</em></p> <p>Makes a lot of sense. And then one, maybe this is for Dan. Can you just speak to how the air traffic liability is trending year to date into the fourth quarter versus your expectations at the start of the year? I know we kicked off the year with really strong first quarter performance on that ETL build. Should we be aware of any impact from normalization of booking windows versus last year, just given the pickup in corporate volume you're seeing?</p><p><strong>Dan Janki</strong> -- <em>Chief Financial Officer</em></p> <p>No. I'd say it's performing as we expected. We're starting to maybe get back to a little bit more of the traditional seasonality. As we were restoring, it was a little bit different.</p> <p>And if you look at historical patterns, you're only down mid-teens as you go through into the fourth quarter, and that's kind of what we saw as we wrapped up the third quarter here. So no. The other element that you have in there is you certainly have -- we've had very friendly policies as it relates to credits, and customers have gotten really used to using them. And then we think that's obviously long-term beneficial that people have confidence to book and travel but also consume when they don't travel.</p> <p>And those, we've seen very consistent issuance and usage rates on them.</p><p><strong>Catherine O'Brien</strong> -- <em>Goldman Sachs -- Analyst</em></p> <p>OK. Thank you so much.</p><p><strong>Operator</strong></p><p>Thank you. Your next question is coming from Mike Linenberg from Deutsche Bank. Your line is live.</p><p><strong>Mike Linenberg</strong> -- <em>Deutsche Bank -- Analyst</em></p> <p>Yeah. Hey. Good morning, everyone. Glen, you called out a couple of sectors that were underperforming from a corporate perspective.</p> <p>I mean, I think of any carrier probably the most indexed to the automotive sector and then sort of the media sector with the writers' and actors' strike. What sort of drag do you actually think that had on your corporates, at least in the month of September and maybe what you're seeing right now?</p><p><strong>Glen Hauenstein</strong> -- <em>President</em></p> <p>Well, clearly, I'll start with Los Angeles and the entertainment production strikes that are ongoing. That has had a not insignificant change in the business travel to and from Los Angeles, as well as now the UAW strike, which has curtailed a significant amount of the business in Detroit. As you point out, we're very big in both of those sectors. And what I'm really encouraged about is despite those two kinds of being things that we should look forward to as positives next year, that our total corporate revenues are still accelerating.</p> <p>So despite those two being a drag on them, and I think hopefully, those are both resolves fairly quickly here and we can get back to a normal business level. But you are right, spot on, that we are probably the most impacted by those two sectors.</p><p><strong>Mike Linenberg</strong> -- <em>Deutsche Bank -- Analyst</em></p> <p>Great. And then just a quick one to Dan or Ed. I didn't see in the release a reiteration of the $7-plus for 2024. I know you're still mid-budget, but just based on the trajectory and everything you're seeing now, that number is still fine?</p><p><strong>Ed Bastian</strong> -- <em>Chief Executive Officer</em></p> <p>That's our plan, Mike. I mentioned that we gave that guide in December of 2021, as long as free cash and others and we're on track.</p><p><strong>Mike Linenberg</strong> -- <em>Deutsche Bank -- Analyst</em></p> <p>Very good. Thank you.</p><p><strong>Operator</strong></p><p>Thank you. Your next question is coming from Ravi Shanker from Morgan Stanley. Your line is live.</p><p><strong>Ravi Shanker</strong> -- <em>Morgan Stanley -- Analyst</em></p> <p>Thanks. Good morning, everyone. Glen, I'm probably going to ask Jamie's initial SkyMiles data mining question in a different way. And based on data that you have, do you have any evidence that traditional domestic travelers have been flying internationally more often in 2023? Maybe people being their first or kind of rare international trips.</p> <p>Just trying to see if there's any truth or data to back up the thesis that there has been substitution of domestic with people flying internationally this year.</p><p><strong>Glen Hauenstein</strong> -- <em>President</em></p> <p>Well, I'd say that's a very broad question, and clearly, there's been an expansion of international. But if you think about domestic and the volume differential between the number of seats we have every day domestically and the number of seats we have every day to Europe, it would be very hard to track those incremental visits back to people who did not fly domestically because it's such a small piece of domestic travel in terms of total volumes. And so while clearly, the spend has been very robust for long-haul in general, we have not seen a diminishing of short-haul either.</p><p><strong>Ravi Shanker</strong> -- <em>Morgan Stanley -- Analyst</em></p> <p>Got it. That's really helpful. And maybe as a follow-up, kind of feels like trans-Pacific has not quite been the explosion of pent-up demand that we saw in domestic and transatlantic when they initially opened, but it looks like 2024 might be a better year for that. Is there any way you think that the historical profitability in that region, which has not been great to say the least, can be better when that initial kind of flow-through of demand comes through with pricing the way it might potentially be?</p><p><strong>Glen Hauenstein</strong> -- <em>President</em></p> <p>Well, I'd disagree with you on your premise there that Pacific has been a laggard. Pacific has been quite robust, and I think we indicated these are our record profits in terms of margins and total profitability in the Pacific. And if you look at the Pacific, absent of China, it's been fully restored. So I think we're very pleased with the demand to the Pacific, and we're -- right now, that's where our capacity is sitting up most in the fourth quarter and where it will be in the first and through next year.</p> <p>And so -- and we're very enthusiastic about the results we're getting there.</p><p><strong>Ravi Shanker</strong> -- <em>Morgan Stanley -- Analyst</em></p> <p>Thanks, Glen.</p><p><strong>Operator</strong></p><p>Thank you. Your next question is coming from Brandon Oglenski from Barclays. Your line is live.</p><p><strong>Brandon Oglenski</strong> -- <em>Barclays -- Analyst</em></p> <p>Yeah. Good morning and thanks for taking my question. Glen, I know you've called out your corporate travel here being up in coastal hub strength, but can you talk to maybe any areas of weakness domestically? And is there like diverging trends with your Main Cabin revenue?</p><p><strong>Glen Hauenstein</strong> -- <em>President</em></p> <p>Well, I think we've called out diverging trends with Main Cabin. Those have been pretty consistent, though, throughout the recovery is it's been led by premium products and services. So that's not inconsistent between quarters. I think it's actually relatively flat in terms of the -- how much premium is driving there.</p> <p>And geographically, I think what we're really excited about is the coastal hub investments we've made and particularly New York, that's something we're looking for in '24. We've -- we see a lot of momentum in the Northeast and New York in particular, as things to look forward to in '24.</p><p><strong>Brandon Oglenski</strong> -- <em>Barclays -- Analyst</em></p> <p>OK. And then on the outlook for next year, growing with your JVs on the international side, how does the changes in Mexico impact as they move to a Category 1 with the FAA?</p><p><strong>Glen Hauenstein</strong> -- <em>President</em></p> <p>Right. Mexico has been a great source of strength for us through the last year, and we see continued strength in those Mexican business. And I think when you think about what we read in the press and what you all see and the onshoring and moving factories from Asia down into Mexico, we've seen really an incredible strength in demand from the business sector in Mexico, and that's looking really robust into 2024. And working with Aeromexico now, we really couldn't do much with them.</p> <p>These are things we wanted to do in the past. You see us coordinating with them. We have an ATI joint venture. So we've been working very closely with them to continue to work on where we see strength and be able to serve those markets better, including the auto sector in Detroit and including Atlanta as a primary gateway to Mexico primary and secondary airports.</p><p><strong>Brandon Oglenski</strong> -- <em>Barclays -- Analyst</em></p> <p>Thank you.</p><p><strong>Operator</strong></p><p>Thank you. Your next question is coming from Helane Becker from TD Cowen. Your line is live.</p><p><strong>Helane Becker</strong> -- <em>TD Cowen -- Analyst</em></p> <p>Thanks very much, operator. Hi, everybody, and thank you very much for the question. Just on -- with respect to as you think about travel next summer on the North Atlantic, especially where U.S. citizens are going to need visas, how are you thinking about communicating that to people as they book trips? Is that going to be in the reservation process or follow-ups? Or how do you avoid surprises?</p><p><strong>Peter Carter</strong> -- <em>Executive Vice President, Chief Legal Officer, and Corporate Secretary</em></p> <p>Helane, it's Peter Carter. Say, we will make sure our customers are aware of the visa requirement at various points along the purchasing path and the journey. And I will tell you that the nice thing about the new visa requirement is it is an e-visa, so it's a fairly straightforward process that we think will take about 24 hours.</p><p><strong>Helane Becker</strong> -- <em>TD Cowen -- Analyst</em></p> <p>Yeah. I think it's like Australia, right, where it's pretty quick unless it's not, I think. OK, that's helpful. And then the other question I had was just on the changes to Israel.</p> <p>How big actually is that in your total -- in the total market? It's a lot of ASMs but it can't be that big in terms of, I guess, exposure.</p><p><strong>Glen Hauenstein</strong> -- <em>President</em></p> <p>It's a little over one point of ASMs. And we're not going to give an exact number but it's included. The revenue hit is included in our fourth-quarter guide so we've extended at least through October and then we'll see what happens. The reason we're not saying how much exposure there is, is we don't know how this will evolve yet so we're staying very fluid.</p> <p>But I think we feel very confident that we can get inside of our guidance ranges here with Israel kind of in a worst-case scenario.</p><p><strong>Helane Becker</strong> -- <em>TD Cowen -- Analyst</em></p> <p>Got it. OK. Thanks very much.</p><p><strong>Julie Stewart</strong> -- <em>Vice President, Investor Relations</em></p> <p>Matthew, we'll now go to our final analyst question.</p><p><strong>Operator</strong></p><p>Certainly. Your last question is coming from Sheila Kahyaoglu from Jefferies. Your line is live.</p><p><strong>Sheila Kahyaoglu</strong> -- <em>Jefferies -- Analyst</em></p> <p>Thank you. Good morning, guys. And I wanted to ask you a question. You made a comment about you're leaning into the cost curve and really leading the industry here with pilot pay and the like.</p> <p>So the question comes, how do we think about your double-digit margins today versus low-cost carriers and what they'll report in Q3 and margin moving pieces maybe into 2024, if you want to provide that or maybe the Delta versus Delta and other carriers?</p><p><strong>Ed Bastian</strong> -- <em>Chief Executive Officer</em></p> <p>Sheila, you should look at our '24 guide that we gave you with our three-year plan. The good news at Delta is that we have all of our labor costs at the new market across the board today in posting those double-digit margins. So to the extent other carriers need to be increasing their labor cost in future negotiations, they're just going to be chasing the Delta cost. And I think that conversion of industry rates is something we've talked about as kind of another opportunity as we look at trying to make sure we're all running a better business here, and we're not -- we have the same incentives to make sure that our costs are finding their way into our pricing.</p><p><strong>Sheila Kahyaoglu</strong> -- <em>Jefferies -- Analyst</em></p> <p>Sure. No, makes sense. And if I could ask one more, a lot on Delta TechOps. Obviously, a big asset for Delta right now.</p> <p>Anything you could talk about? I think you've previously said GTF shop is that they're running at 70 to 80 engines. I don't know if that was only GTF or all engines ramping to potentially 400. Maybe if you could just give us the -- talk about the opportunity longer term with Delta TechOps and what utilization is.</p><p><strong>Dan Janki</strong> -- <em>Chief Financial Officer</em></p> <p>Yes. Talked about it at baseline this year, TechOps for geared turbofan engine overhauls would be in the 150, 160 range. We have built capacity to take that to -- up to 350 and continue to discuss long-term -- medium- and longer-term capacity needs with Pratt related to that. So we talked about it at Investor Day.</p> <p>Very optimistic about our position, not only the heritage that we have and the great expertise that we have in the Delta TechOps team, but our positioning as it relates to being on all the key next-generation platforms, whether that's geared turbofan, whether that's rolls and also the LEAP engine create a real set of opportunities for us as we think about this business and multiples of what it can be today over the medium and long term.</p><p><strong>Sheila Kahyaoglu</strong> -- <em>Jefferies -- Analyst</em></p> <p>Thank you so much.</p><p><strong>Julie Stewart</strong> -- <em>Vice President, Investor Relations</em></p> <p>That will wrap the analyst portion of the call. I'll now turn it over to Tim Mapes to start the media questions.</p><p><strong>Tim Mapes</strong> -- <em>Chief Marketing and Communications Officer</em></p> <p>Thank you, Julie. Matthew, if we could, as we transition from the analyst questions to those from the members of the media, maybe repeat the instructions for everyone, please.</p><p><strong>Operator</strong></p><p>Certainly. At this time, we'll be conducting a Q&amp;A session for media questions. [Operator instructions] Your first question is coming from Dawn Gilbertson from Wall Street Journal. Your line is live.</p><p><strong>Dawn Gilbertson</strong> -- <em>Air Travel Reporter</em></p> <p>Hi. Good morning. Ed, I wonder if you could give us any more color, or Glen, on the reaction to the SkyMiles changes and when you expect to announce the things you might be rolling back or changing?</p><p><strong>Ed Bastian</strong> -- <em>Chief Executive Officer</em></p> <p>Hi, Dawn. We've -- I've mentioned publicly over the last couple of weeks that we're certainly receiving good feedback from our customers with respect to the changes. I have indicated that we had too many changes rolled out at the same time, and we needed to go back and reassess the planned rollout for the new qualification levels. I mentioned this morning on the CNBC interview, there's two things, though, that are common throughout all of the feedback.</p> <p>One is there is the intense loyalty to Delta, which is really heartwarming to see. The loyalty to this brand is great. We've worked hard to build it and we maintain that. We will continue to maintain that.</p> <p>There should be no question about that. And secondly, that most everyone also agrees that something has to be done because everyone sees that the premium number of customers that we continue to build are in excess of the premium assets that we have to offer. And so figuring out how to better rationalize and make certain that the service levels for our premium customers are where they need to be is, there's various ways to get it. We've received a lot of ideas as to different ways to think about it, and you'll be hearing from us in the coming days.</p><p><strong>Dawn Gilbertson</strong> -- <em>Air Travel Reporter</em></p> <p>OK. If I could just have one quick follow-up on that front. What is driving -- in terms of the reaction, I mean, are you seeing just feedback or are you seeing an impact on credit card sign-ups and/or cancellations? I mean, what's driving this pretty quick change to your initial plans?</p><p><strong>Ed Bastian</strong> -- <em>Chief Executive Officer</em></p> <p>Well, it's the feedback. It's not -- no, we're not seeing any change in trajectory rather on acquisitions or changes in spend levels. Everything continues to stay intact, as Glen, I think mentioned during some of his comments. This is good feedback that we're seeing and candidly, with some of it, I agree with them.</p><p><strong>Dawn Gilbertson</strong> -- <em>Air Travel Reporter</em></p> <p>Thank you.</p><p><strong>Operator</strong></p><p>Thank you. Your next question is coming from Alison Sider from Wall Street Journal. Your line is live.</p><p><strong>Alison Sider</strong> -- <em>Air Travel Reporter</em></p> <p>Hey. Thanks so much. There's been some analysis recently about sort of the potential impact of cost savings if people really started taking weight loss drugs like Ozempic in big numbers. Is that something you look at, at all? As you factor that into your fuel projections or anything like that?</p><p><strong>Ed Bastian</strong> -- <em>Chief Executive Officer</em></p> <p>No. We don't, Ali.</p><p><strong>Alison Sider</strong> -- <em>Air Travel Reporter</em></p> <p>And then if I could follow up. I was also curious on potential Israel evacuation flights. I know there's ongoing discussions with the government on this. But would Delta be open to flying Israel under a charter if the government asks or if there was a craft activation? Or would you rather just fly to points outside of Israel? Is there any openness, I guess, to flying kind of under those circumstances?</p><p><strong>Ed Bastian</strong> -- <em>Chief Executive Officer</em></p> <p>There are discussions, as I've indicated. Right now, we're looking at providing some additional lift to Europe to get people out of Europe. But no, we don't have any plans to be flying into Israel. It's considered unsafe for a U.S.</p> <p>carrier to operate in that airspace currently.</p><p><strong>Alison Sider</strong> -- <em>Air Travel Reporter</em></p> <p>Thank you.</p><p><strong>Operator</strong></p><p>Thank you. Your next question is coming from Mary Schlangenstein from Bloomberg News. Your line is live.</p><p><strong>Mary Schlangenstein</strong> -- <em>Airline Reporter</em></p> <p>Hi. Good morning. I wanted to ask real quickly, with the ongoing slot waiver situation in New York where the airlines were asked to reduce capacity because of the congestion in the air traffic controller shortage, can you talk about how much of that Delta is taking advantage of? And whether you expect that if it continues long term to start to have some significant impact? Also whether you're redeploying that capacity into other markets?</p><p><strong>Glen Hauenstein</strong> -- <em>President</em></p> <p>Well, thanks for that question. Yes, we're planning on using the entirety of the slot waiver which is, I believe, 10% of our flights into and out of Kennedy and LaGuardia in order to help with the airspace congestion issues that are surrounding those airports right now. So what we're trying to do is have minimal impact. We will not withdraw from any individual markets.</p> <p>We will thin out some frequencies. We'll put some larger gauge in. And any of the assets that are freed up from New York will get redeployed into other parts of our network for now. But it shouldn't really be very different than the summer.</p> <p>As you know, that's rolled forward from the summer, which we had 10% out, and that's just extending it through the winter. So you won't see really, I think, any dramatic changes to our schedule versus where we're sitting today.</p><p><strong>Mary Schlangenstein</strong> -- <em>Airline Reporter</em></p> <p>Does that become a broader problem for you if that continues to be extended?</p><p><strong>Glen Hauenstein</strong> -- <em>President</em></p> <p>I think the broader problem is not being able to operate in the New York airspace. And so I think we're working very closely with the government to see what we can do to improve the situation there. It was very difficult on our customers this summer, and certainly, we're all hoping for some relief by next summer.</p><p><strong>Peter Carter</strong> -- <em>Executive Vice President, Chief Legal Officer, and Corporate Secretary</em></p> <p>And Mary, we really -- this is Peter Carter. We really appreciate the FAA providing that relief and acknowledging that there is a constraint in the northeast with respect to the staffing of air traffic controllers. And frankly, that's the thing that we need to really solve as an industry.</p><p><strong>Mary Schlangenstein</strong> -- <em>Airline Reporter</em></p> <p>OK. Thank you.</p><p><strong>Operator</strong></p><p>Thank you. Your next question is coming from Leslie Josephs from CNBC. Your line is live.</p><p><strong>Leslie Josephs</strong> -- <em>Airline Reporter</em></p> <p>Hi. Good morning. We keep seeing airfares fall, and I was wondering if you could talk a little bit about what kind of discounting you're having to do in the fall. And then have you made any capacity changes on days when people might have traveled in the off-peak and maybe they're going back to more traditional bookings, if that's the case?</p><p><strong>Glen Hauenstein</strong> -- <em>President</em></p> <p>Sure. I think the most recent data that came out this morning had been flat to up slightly month-over-month, so I don't think that as an industry level, that's a good indication. What we've seen is that actually June was our lowest point in terms of year-over-year average fares and it's moved up for us since then. And that's really driven by the premium side and the success we've had in terms of selling more premium and the fares we're getting for our premium products and services.</p> <p>So yes, at the bottom end, there's some discounting. There's also some fare initiatives. So it's always a very fluid situation. And right now, I think we're very -- we're calling it stable between third quarter and fourth quarter.</p><p><strong>Leslie Josephs</strong> -- <em>Airline Reporter</em></p> <p>And the fares that you're discounting to, is that like on par with 2019 or is that -- like is there a kind of a reference point for?</p><p><strong>Glen Hauenstein</strong> -- <em>President</em></p> <p>Yes. Certain markets are, certain markets are above. So I think the market basket is there -- at the very bottom end, they may be slightly below where they were in '19, but not really. There's always a fare in a market that is below, but in general, they're not.</p><p><strong>Leslie Josephs</strong> -- <em>Airline Reporter</em></p> <p>Thanks.</p><p><strong>Tim Mapes</strong> -- <em>Chief Marketing and Communications Officer</em></p> <p>Thank you, Leslie. Matthew, we have time for one final question, please.</p><p><strong>Operator</strong></p><p>Certainly. Your last question is coming from David Slotnick from TPG. Your line is live.</p><p><strong>David Slotnick</strong> -- <em>Senior Aviation Business Reporter</em></p> <p>Good morning and thank you for taking the question. Going back to the loyalty program, were you surprised by the customer reaction and I suppose the degree of it? And what were you sort of expecting instead of that effect?</p><p><strong>Ed Bastian</strong> -- <em>Chief Executive Officer</em></p> <p>We were certainly expecting some feedback. And by the way, some of the feedback we've received is very positive and encourages us not to make any changes. So there wasn't any one cohort that was silent on the matter. We have a full 360 view of the perspective.</p> <p>But it gives us a chance to sit back, reflect on it. And there were points about the program that I thought that we could make some modifications to. There still will be changes to the program. I've been very clear about that, but we're going to make modifications to what we announced.</p><p><strong>David Slotnick</strong> -- <em>Senior Aviation Business Reporter</em></p> <p>And just a follow-up. Was American Express expecting any changes to the premium card demand just with the lounge access? Do they think that that's potentially going to fall? And if so, will that impact your royalty revenue?</p><p><strong>Glen Hauenstein</strong> -- <em>President</em></p> <p>American Express, we, of course, did this with full back-and-forth knowledge, so we did this together with American Express. And if anything, since we've announced it, we've seen a shift to higher premium card acquisitions. So I think we're well within from that perspective where we thought we'd be.</p><p><strong>David Slotnick</strong> -- <em>Senior Aviation Business Reporter</em></p> <p>Thank you.</p><p><strong>Tim Mapes</strong> -- <em>Chief Marketing and Communications Officer</em></p> <p>Thank you, David. And Matthew, I think that will conclude our call.</p><p><strong>Operator</strong></p><p>[Operator signoff]</p> <p><strong>Duration: 0 minutes</strong></p><h2>Call participants:</h2><p><strong>Julie Stewart</strong> -- <em>Vice President, Investor Relations</em></p><p><strong>Ed Bastian</strong> -- <em>Chief Executive Officer</em></p><p><strong>Glen Hauenstein</strong> -- <em>President</em></p><p><strong>Dan Janki</strong> -- <em>Chief Financial Officer</em></p><p><strong>Jamie Baker</strong> -- <em>JPMorgan Chase and Company -- Analyst</em></p><p><strong>Savi Syth</strong> -- <em>Raymond James -- Analyst</em></p><p><strong>Conor Cunningham</strong> -- <em>Melius Research -- Analyst</em></p><p><strong>Duane Pfennigwerth</strong> -- <em>Evercore ISI -- Analyst</em></p><p><strong>Andrew Didora</strong> -- <em>Bank of America Merrill Lynch -- Analyst</em></p><p><strong>Catherine O'Brien</strong> -- <em>Goldman Sachs -- Analyst</em></p><p><strong>Mike Linenberg</strong> -- <em>Deutsche Bank -- Analyst</em></p><p><strong>Ravi Shanker</strong> -- <em>Morgan Stanley -- Analyst</em></p><p><strong>Brandon Oglenski</strong> -- <em>Barclays -- Analyst</em></p><p><strong>Helane Becker</strong> -- <em>TD Cowen -- Analyst</em></p><p><strong>Peter Carter</strong> -- <em>Executive Vice President, Chief Legal Officer, and Corporate Secretary</em></p><p><strong>Sheila Kahyaoglu</strong> -- <em>Jefferies -- Analyst</em></p><p><strong>Tim Mapes</strong> -- <em>Chief Marketing and Communications Officer</em></p><p><strong>Dawn Gilbertson</strong> -- <em>Air Travel Reporter</em></p><p><strong>Alison Sider</strong> -- <em>Air Travel Reporter</em></p><p><strong>Mary Schlangenstein</strong> -- <em>Airline Reporter</em></p><p><strong>Leslie Josephs</strong> -- <em>Airline Reporter</em></p><p><strong>David Slotnick</strong> -- <em>Senior Aviation Business Reporter</em></p>\n",

We appreciate you joining us. Before we start, I want to acknowledge the unfolding war in Israel and the tragic loss of life that has ensued. Delta is donating $1 million to the American Red Cross for the International Committee of the Red Cross to help fund humanitarian efforts in the conflict.</p> <p>This includes emergency assistance such as health services, emergency care, ambulance services, and other critical needs. Our inbound and outbound flights to Tel Aviv have been suspended through October 31 to ensure the safety and security of our customers and employees. We're also offering a customer waiver for travel to Tel Aviv for those who need to change their travel plans. Our hearts are with everyone impacted by these tragic and horrific events.</p> <p>Turning to our news for the day. This morning, Delta reported September quarter results, posting earnings of $2.03 per share, a 35% increase over last year. Revenue grew 13% and we achieved a 13.5% operating margin. This resulted in operating income of $2 billion, bringing our operating profit over the last 12 months to over $6 billion.</p> <p>The Delta people delivered for our customers throughout the very busy summer season, and I'm grateful to our teams for all they do for our customers and each other every day. Our people are the foundation of Delta and are our most important competitive strength. Sharing our financial success with our people is a long-standing pillar of Delta's culture. With this quarter's financial performance, we accrued another $420 million toward next February's profit sharing.</p><div class=\"interad\"></div> <p>This brings our profit-sharing accrual to over $1 billion year to date, marking an important and exciting milestone for the Delta team. The great work of our 100,000 people was recently recognized as Delta ranked No. 12 overall on Time Magazine's list of The World's Best Companies. We were the only airline to make the top 100 of this prestigious list.</p> <p>And USA Today readers just selected Delta as the Best Airline in the World. Our operational fundamentals remain strong, underscored by Delta's industry-leading position in on-time arrivals and blue sky operational performance that is reliably back to pre-COVID levels. Following a high number of irregular operations days early in the quarter driven by weather and ATC constraints, we have seen consistent improvement in our operating metrics. In October, we are running a near-perfect completion factor across the mainline system, and we remain No.</p> <p>1 in on-time arrivals year to date. As we're now in the final phase of our recovery, we are making important forward-leaning investments in the health and reliability of our fleet. These maintenance investments will position us to consistently deliver the operational excellence that underpins Delta's brand. Running a high-quality operation is critical to being the airline of choice for our customers and driving a competitive cost structure.</p> <p>Dan will speak more to this shortly. During the quarter, we also made a $150 million strategic investment in Wheels Up, co-investing alongside Certares Management, Knighthead Capital, and others. This new investment structure combines the No. 1 premium commercial airline with the travel and tourism expertise of Certares and the turnaround expertise of Knighthead.</p> <p>Delta's relationship with Wheels Up creates a new premium product line for our customers, and I look forward to working with our co-investors and the new management team to unlock the full value of this uniquely positioned business. Turning to our outlook. Travel remains a top purchase priority and our core customer base is in a healthy financial position. We continue to see strength in bookings across Delta's global network, driven by our consumers.</p> <p>Demand for premium experiences, international travel, and increasing business travel further differentiate the trends that Delta is seeing within the industry. We expect our December quarter revenues to be 10% higher than 2022 with a 10% operating margin and earnings of over $1 per share. This brings our expectation for full-year earnings to over $6 per share on a double-digit operating margin and free cash flow of $2 billion. Since raising full-year guidance over the summer, our revenue outlook has improved, though earnings and cash flow have been impacted by higher fuel and maintenance costs.</p> <p>Revenue for the full year is expected to increase 20% over last year, which was the high end of our expectations on steady domestic demand and continued strength in international. With strong top-line growth and margin expansion, we expect to double earnings year over year and deliver a 13% return on invested capital. Our outlook for 2023 keeps revenue, earnings, cash flow, and debt reduction on track with our three-year plan, which we issued in December of '21. As we progress through the recovery, we have made meaningful investments in operational reliability and our people.</p> <p>Delta has led the industry in setting the bar for wages, including a new pilot deal and profit sharing. We are seeing the structural step-up in operating costs amid increasing fuel prices, creating some near-term pressure on industry margins. However, I fully expect that the market will adjust to higher costs as it has historically and reestablished equilibrium. With Delta's differentiated premium revenue strategy and strong global network, we will continue to deliver industry-leading profitability and generate robust free cash flow.</p> <p>In closing, the strategy that we shared at Investor Day positions us well for the future. And while the environment we operate in continues to evolve in this post-COVID world, our objectives are unchanged as we move into 2024. With our network rebuilt and growth now moderating, optimizing the airline and driving efficiency are significant opportunities. Thank you again for your support of our company.</p> <p>And with that, let me hand it over to Glen and to Dan to go through the details of the quarter.</p><p><strong>Glen Hauenstein</strong> -- <em>President</em></p> <p>Thank you, Ed, and good morning. I want to start by thanking all of our employees for their hard work and dedication during the busy summer travel season. In the September quarter, Delta generated revenue of $14.6 billion, up 13% over prior year. Total unit revenues were down 2.5%, including a point of pressure from cargo and MRO.</p> <p>With these results, I expect Delta to deliver a record September quarter unit revenue premium versus the industry, reflecting the continued success of our commercial strategy. Domestic passenger revenue was up 6% over prior year. Performance was steady through the quarter with strength in our coastal hubs where we are leveraging our leading positions in generational airport bills. International passenger revenue grew 35%, with the transatlantic and Pacific outperforming our already high expectations.</p> <p>We delivered record margins across all international entities this summer and strength is continuing through the fall. Demand for our premium products is very strong with revenue up 17% over prior year, outperforming Main Cabin by five points. Domestic paid load factor in our first-class cabins was a record as we continue to advance our premium merchandising and upsell capabilities. Delta Premium Select has now been rolled out to over 85% of long-haul flights, and the revenue generation from this product has been above expectations and a key contributor to our record international margins.</p> <p>Business travel continues to steadily improve as corporates continue with return-to-office initiatives. Less recovered sectors like technology and financial services saw a double-digit growth during the quarter. A recent corporate survey indicates continued growth in business demand with a significant majority of companies expecting their travel to stay the same or increase as we move into 4Q and into '24. SME and hybrid travelers are producing margins in line with corporate travelers and demand from these travels remains well above 2019 levels.</p> <p>Total loyalty revenue was up 17% over prior year with continued strength in our American Express co-brand portfolio. Amex remuneration of $1.7 billion grew approximately 20% over prior year. We expect full-year remuneration of close to $7 billion and are focused on reaching our long-term goal of $10 billion. Diversified revenue streams, including premium and loyalty have generated 55% of revenue year to date, reflecting Delta's differentiated positioning to the industry.</p> <p>Turning to the December quarter, we expect total unit revenue to grow 9% to 12% over prior year, bringing our full-year revenues to up 20% over prior year. This is at the high end of our guidance even with a few points less capacity than we had planned for the year, reflecting robust demand for the Delta product. Capacity in the fourth quarter is expected to be up 14% to 15%, implying total unit revenues down 2.5% to 4.5% versus prior year. Domestic and transatlantic trends are expected to be consistent with the third quarter.</p> <p>Pacific and Latin America unit revenue trends are expected to be modest -- excuse me, expected to modestly decelerate, given capacity growth related to China reopening and investment in our LATAM JV. Domestic demand remains steady and initial bookings for the peak holiday periods are strong. The ongoing UAW and actor strikes are having a modest impact and we have incorporated those into our outlook. As we move through the fourth quarter, our domestic capacity growth moderates, and in the first quarter of 2024 we expect domestic capacity to be flat to slightly down year over year.</p> <p>We have reallocated capacity to international leisure where we are expecting strong returns and remain focused on fully restoring our higher-margin core hubs. On international, we are seeing continued demand strength through the winter. The transatlantic remains very strong, driven by partner hubs and southern European leisure traffic performance. We're closely monitoring the situation in Israel as we will evaluate restarting the flights as the situation stabilizes.</p> <p>In the Pacific, we expect to grow December quarter capacity 40% to 50% as we continue restoring the network. While this level of growth will impact unit revenue, we expect the new flying will be profit accretive. For the year, we remain confident in finishing strong with record profitability across all three international entities. In closing, I'm proud of the revenue performance our teams have delivered, and I'm confident that our integrated commercial strategy will continue to drive industry-leading profitability.</p> <p>And with that, I'll turn it over to Dan to talk about the financials.</p><p><strong>Dan Janki</strong> -- <em>Chief Financial Officer</em></p> <p>Thank you, Glen, and good morning to everyone. For the September quarter, we delivered earnings of $2.03 per share and operating margin of 13.5%. Nonfuel unit costs were up 1.3% year over year and fuel prices averaged $2.78 a gallon, including a refinery benefit of $0.11. We generated operating cash flow of $1.1 billion and we reinvested $1.4 billion into the business.</p> <p>Liquidity ended the quarter at $7.8 billion and adjusted net debt of $20.2 billion. Year to date, we've repaid $3.7 billion of gross debt. This is including $1.7 billion of accelerated repayments on our higher-cost debt. Our leverage ratio improved to three times on a trailing 12-month basis.</p> <p>During the quarter, S&amp;P upgraded our credit rating to BB+, one notch away from investment grade, a recognition of our improving financial foundation. Our capital allocation priorities are reinvesting in the business and improving our balance sheet to investment-grade metrics with a modest cash return to shareholders through our dividend. Now moving to guidance. For the December quarter, we expect nonfuel unit costs to be flat to up 2% on a year-over-year basis.</p> <p>With the exception of maintenance costs, our second-half unit costs are progressing as expected. As we discussed in September, there are three drivers to higher maintenance: first, investment in fleet health; second, expanded work scope on our 757 engine fleet; and third, challenges across the supply chain. On fleet health and reliability, our investments are starting to deliver improved operational performance. Our September metrics were ahead of August and October is ahead of September.</p> <p>On the 757 engine, a workhorse in our fleet, we're going through a wave of overhauls. The engines we took off-wing over the summer required larger work scope and a higher mix of new parts. Looking forward, we are forecasting higher new material consumption rates. On supply chain, the industry continues to face challenges that will take time to work through.</p> <p>Engine and airframe turnaround times remain elevated, driving inefficiency and impacting productivity. We are working closely with our partners and leveraging our deep expertise in TechOps to manage supply chain challenges. Delta has a long heritage of industry-leading operational performance, driven by the best TechOps capability in the industry. Operational excellence is central to our brand promise and a key pacing item to drive out inefficiencies.</p> <p>Moving to fuel. Fuel prices have moved higher since July, adding roughly $400 million of expense to our outlook for the second half of the year. We expect December fuel prices to be $2.90 to $3.20 per gallon, with the refinery expected to be roughly breakeven for the quarter. The refinery turnaround is progressing as we planned and we expect production to resume in mid-November.</p> <p>Based on our December quarter outlook for revenue and costs, we expect earnings of $1.05 to $1.30 per share on a 9% to 11% operating margin. This brings our full-year outlook to earnings to $6 to $6.25 per share on double-digit operating margin and free cash flow of $2 billion. We are focused on finishing the year strong. We remain committed to delivering industry-leading margin performance, earnings growth, and strong cash generation.</p> <p>As we progress through the 2024 planning process, our focus is shifting from restoration to optimization. Over the last two years, we've grown at an unprecedented rate for an airline of our size to restore our network. Growth is normalizing next year, and we expect operational reliability to continue to improve. This will allow us to optimize how we run the airline, reducing operational buffers and driving out inefficiencies that have resulted from the intensity of the rebuild.</p> <p>Our capacity growth for 2024 will be focused on Delta's areas of strength. Domestically, we are prioritizing our core high-margin hubs, driving connectivity and gauge. Internationally, we are leveraging our best-in-class JV partnerships and increasing the mix of flying on next-generation aircraft. We are executing against the strategy and financial objectives we laid out at our Investor Day, with an emphasis on free cash flow, earnings durability, and capital efficiency.</p> <p>In closing, Delta is well-positioned to maintain industry leadership operationally and financially. I'd like to sincerely thank the Delta people for everything they do every day. With that, I'll turn it back to Julie for Q&amp;A.</p><p><strong>Julie Stewart</strong> -- <em>Vice President, Investor Relations</em></p> <p>Thanks, Dan.
